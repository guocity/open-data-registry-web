    "Description": "The [Sequence Read Archive (SRA)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra/) is the primary archive of high-throughput sequencing data, hosted by the National Institutes of Health (NIH). The SRA represents the largest publicly available repository of SARS-CoV-2 sequencing data. This dataset was created by DNAstack using SARS-CoV-2 sequencing data sourced from the SRA. Where possible, raw sequence data were processed by DNAstack through a unified bioinformatics pipeline to produce genome assemblies and variant calls. The use of a standardized workflow to produce this harmonized dataset allows public data generated using different methodologies to be combined and compared for a more powerful global analysis of available SARS-CoV-2 data, allowing researchers rapid access to aggregated downstream results for accelerated insight generation. Methodology: Reads from the SRA were extracted in FASTQ format, then entered into a different pipeline depending on the sequencing technology used to create the reads: the [ARTIC protocol](https://artic.network/ncov-2019/ncov2019-bioinformatics-sop.html) for Oxford Nanopore-derived reads; the [SIGNAL pipeline](https://github.com/jaleezyy/covid-19-signal) for paired-end Illumina reads; and the [CoSA pipeline](https://github.com/PacificBiosciences/CoSA) (using [DeepVariant](https://github.com/google/deepvariant) for variant calling) for PacBio reads. Briefly, reads were primer-trimmed and aligned to the SARS-CoV-2 reference genome, following which contiguous regions were assembled and variant sites were called. [Pangolin](https://github.com/cov-lineages/pangolin) was then used to assign viral lineage based on the assembled genome.\n",

    "Name": "Ocean Radar - Rottnest shelf site - Sea water velocity - Delayed mode",
    "Description": "The Rottnest Shelf (ROT) HF ocean radar system covers an area which includes Rottnest Island and the Perth Canyon to the north-west.  The Perth Canyon has the highest marine biodiversity in the region with whale and fish aggregations, and high primary and secondary productions which are controlled by the physical oceanographic processes.  \n\nCombined with the dynamics of the Perth Canyon is the dominant Leeuwin Current which produces a wake on the leeward side of Rottnest Island.   This is a topographically induced up-welling and associated primary and secondary productivity.  The region is influenced by Swan River outflow, submarine groundwater discharges , and waste-water outfalls.  \n\nThe ROT HF ocean radar is a WERA phased array system with 16-element receive arrays located at Fremantle (32.031 S, 115.746 E) and Guilderton (31.342 S, 115.489 E).  These radars operate at a frequency of 8.512 MHz, with a bandwidth of 33 KHz and a maximum range of 200 Km.  Within the HF radar coverage area surface currents are measured.  Data are also collected from which wind directions and significant wave height can be calculated.  \n\nThe ROT area of coverage has a small overlap of commonly observed ocean with the Turqoise Coast (TURQ) SeaSonde HF ocean radar system on its north side.  Together, the ROT and TURQ systems provide continuous monitoring of the shelf from Fremantle to Jurien Bay.",

    "Description": "M2I3NVAER (or  inst3_3d_aer_Nv) is an instantaneous 3-dimensional 3-hourly data collection in Modern-Era Retrospective analysis for Research and Applications version 2 (MERRA-2).  This collection consists of assimilations of aerosol mixing ratio parameters at 72 model layers, such as dust, sulphur dioxide, sea salt, black carbon, and organic carbon.  The data field is available every three hour starting from 00:00 UTC, e.g.: 00:00, 03:00, … , 21:00 UTC. Section 4.2 of the MERRA-2 File Specification document provides pressure values nominal for a 1000 hPa surface pressure and refers to the top edge of the layer. The lev=1 is for the top layer, and lev=72 is for the bottom (or surface) model layer. \n\nMERRA-2 is the latest version of global atmospheric reanalysis for the satellite era produced by NASA Global Modeling and Assimilation Office (GMAO) using the Goddard Earth Observing System Model (GEOS) version 5.12.4.  The dataset covers the period of 1980-present with the latency of ~3 weeks after the end of a month. \n\nData Reprocessing:  Please check “Records of MERRA-2 Data Reprocessing and Service Changes” linked from the “Documentation” tab on this page.  Note that a reprocessed data filename is different from the original file.\n\nMERRA-2 Mailing List: Sign up to receive information on reprocessing of data, changing of tools and services, as well as data announcements from GMAO. Contact the GES DISC Help Desk (gsfc-dl-help-disc@mail.nasa.gov) to be added to the list.\n\nQuestions: If you have a question, please read \"MERRA-2 File Specification Document\",  “MERRA-2 Data Access – Quick Start Guide”, and FAQs linked from the ”Documentation” tab on this page.  If that does not answer your question, you may post your question to the NASA Earthdata Forum (forum.earthdata.nasa.gov) or email the GES DISC Help Desk (gsfc-dl-help-disc@mail.nasa.gov).\nRead our doc on how to get AWS Credentials to retrieve this data: https://data.gesdisc.earthdata.nasa.gov/s3credentialsREADME",

It contains Ellipsoid-projected Top-of-Atmosphere (TOA) Radiance, resampled at the surface and topographically corrected, as well as geometrically corrected by PGE22. Data collection for this product is ongoing.\r\n\r\nMISR itself is an instrument designed to view Earth with cameras pointed in 9 different directions. As the instrument flies overhead, each piece of Earth's surface below is successively imaged by all 9 cameras, in each of 4 wavelengths (blue, green, red, and near-infrared). The goal of MISR is to improve our understanding of the affects of sunlight on Earth, as well as distinguish different types of clouds, particles and surfaces. Specifically, MISR monitors the monthly, seasonal, and long-term trends in three areas: 1) amount and type of atmospheric particles (aerosols), including those formed by natural sources and by human activities; 2) amounts, types, and heights of clouds, and 3) distribution of land surface cover, including vegetation canopy structure.\nRead our doc on how to get AWS Credentials to retrieve this data: https://data.asdc.earthdata.nasa.gov/s3credentialsREADME",

    "Name": "Ocean Gliders - Delayed mode",
    "Description": "The Australian National Facility for Ocean Gliders (ANFOG), with IMOS/NCRIS funding, deploys a fleet of eight gliders around Australia. The data represented by this record, are presented in delayed mode. The underwater ocean glider represents a technological revolution for oceanography. Autonomous ocean gliders can be built relatively cheaply, are controlled remotely and are reusable allowing them to make repeated subsurface ocean observations at a fraction of the cost of conventional methods. The data retrieved from the glider fleet will contribute to the study of the major boundary current systems surrounding Australia and their links to coastal ecosystems. The ANFOG glider fleet consists of two types; Slocum gliders and Seagliders. Slocum gliders (named for Joshua Slocum, the first solo global circumnavigator), manufactured by Webb Research Corp are optimised for shallow coastal waters (<200m) where high manoeuvrability is needed. ANFOG will have three Slocum gliders for deployment on the continental shelf. Seagliders, built at the University of Washington, are designed to operate more efficiently in the open ocean up to 1000m water depth. ANFOG uses their five Seagliders to monitor the boundary currents and continental shelves, which is valuable for gathering long-term environmental records of physical, chemical and biological data not widely measured to date. Whilst the Slocum gliders, due to their low cost and operational flexibility, will be of great use in intensive coastal monitoring, both types of gliders weigh only 52kg, enabling them to be launched from small boats. They have a suite of sensors able to record temperature, salinity, dissolved oxygen, turbidity, dissolved organic matter and chlorophyll against position and depth Sustained ocean observations will allow researchers to document the natural variability of the ocean, and better understand the effect of climate change on coastal ecosystems. The IMOS gliders will focus particularly on the major boundary currents that run down the Australian coast, the Leeuwin in the west and the East Australian Current (EAC). The study of these currents is critical for understanding the north-south transport of freshwater, heat and biogeochemical properties. The currents exert a large influence on coastal ecosystems, shipping lanes and fisheries.",

The current operational \nGFS is run at 64 layers in the vertical extending from the surface to the upper\nstratosphere and on six cubic-sphere tiles at  the C768 or 13-km horizontal\nresolution.  A new version of the GFS that has 127 layers extending to the\nmesopause will be implemented for operation on February 3, 2021.   These initial\nconditions are made available four times per day for running forecasts at the\n00Z, 06Z, 12Z and 18Z cycles, respectively.   For each cycle, the dataset\ncontains the first guess of the atmosphere states found in the directory\n./gdas.yyyymmdd/hh-6/RESTART, which are  6-hour GDAS forecast from the last\ncycle,  and atmospheric analysis increments and surface analysis for the current\ncycle  found in the directory ./gfs.yyyymmdd/hh, which are produced by the data\nassimilation systems. \n",

    "Name": "Ocean Radar - Coffs Harbour site - Wind - Delayed mode",
    "Description": "The Coffs Harbour (COF) HF ocean radar site is located near the point at which the East Australian Current (EAC) begins to separate from the coast.  Here the EAC is at its narrowest and swiftest: to the north it is forming from the westwards subtropical jet, and to the south it forms eddies and eventually the warm water moves eastwards across the Tasman Sea, forming a front with the cold water of the Southern Ocean.  \n\nThe connection between coastal and continental shelf waters is fundamental to the understanding of the anthropogenic impact on the coastal ocean and the role of the ocean in mitigating urban marine water quality. The oceans off Eastern Australia and in particular in the region of New South Wales have a complex circulation structure, and are strongly connected with other regional seas and currents. \n\nThe East Australia Current (EAC) flows from tropical regions southward along the NSW continental slope, bringing tropical biota southward. These current structures provide strong physical and biological connectivity, allowing substantial transport and dispersion of biota between regions, and influencing the transport and upwelling of nutrients, which are fundamental to biological productivity.  \n\nThe COF HF ocean radar is a WERA phased array system with 16-element receive arrays located at Red Rock (-23.942 S, 151.371 E) to the north of Coffs Harbour and North Nambucca (-24.111 S, 152.713 E) to the south.  The area of focus is off Coffs Harbour where IMOS and the NSW government have mooring sites.  These radars operate at a frequency of 13.920 MHz, with a bandwidth of 100 KHz and a maximum range of 100 Km.  Within the HF radar coverage area surface currents are measured.  Data are also collected from which wind directions and significant wave height can be calculated.",

    "Description": "The [NOAA Continuously Operating Reference Stations (CORS) Network (NCN)](https://geodesy.noaa.gov/CORS/), managed by NOAA/National Geodetic Survey ([NGS](https://geodesy.noaa.gov/)), provide Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) data, supporting three dimensional positioning, meteorology, space weather, and geophysical applications throughout the United States. The NCN is a multi-purpose, multi-agency cooperative endeavor, combining the efforts of hundreds of government, academic, and private organizations. The stations are independently owned and operated. Each agency shares their GNSS/GPS carrier phase and code range measurements and station metadata with NGS, which are analyzed and distributed free of charge.\nNGS provides access to all NCN data collected since 9 February (040) 1994.\n- #### Access to NCN Data and Products\n    - [NOAA-NCN on AWS](https://noaa-cors-pds.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html)\n    - [NGS server: https://geodesy.noaa.gov/corsdata/](https://geodesy.noaa.gov/corsdata/)\n    - [NGS's customized data request service (UFCORS)](https://geodesy.noaa.gov/UFCORS/)\n- #### NCN Data and Products\n    - **RINEX**: The GPS/GNSS data collected at NCN stations are made available to the public by NGS in Receiver INdependent EXchange (RINEX) format.

    "Description": "The Legal Entity Identifier (LEI) is a 20-character, alpha-numeric code based on the ISO 17442 standard developed by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO). It connects to key reference information that enables clear and unique identification of legal entities participating in financial transactions. Each LEI contains information about an entity’s ownership structure and thus answers the questions of 'who is who’ and ‘who owns whom’. Simply put, the publicly available LEI data pool can be regarded as a global directory, which greatly enhances transparency in the global marketplace. The Financial Stability Board (FSB) has reiterated that global LEI adoption underpins “multiple financial stability objectives” such as improved risk management in firms as well as better assessment of micro and macro prudential risks. As a result, it promotes market integrity while containing market abuse and financial fraud. Last but not least, LEI rollout “supports higher quality and accuracy of financial data overall”. The publicly available LEI data pool is a unique key to standardized information on legal entities globally. The data is registered and regularly verified according to protocols and procedures established by the Regulatory Oversight Committee. In cooperation with its partners in the Global LEI System, the Global Legal Entity Identifier Foundation (GLEIF) continues to focus on further optimizing the quality, reliability and usability of LEI data, empowering market participants to benefit from the wealth of information available with the LEI population. The drivers of the LEI initiative, i.e. the Group of 20, the FSB and many regulators around the world, have emphasized the need to make the LEI a broad public good. The Global LEI Index, made available by GLEIF, greatly contributes to meeting this objective. It puts the complete LEI data at the disposal of any interested party, conveniently and free of charge. The benefits for the wider business community to be generated with the Global LEI Index grow in line with the rate of LEI adoption. To maximize the benefits of entity identification across financial markets and beyond, firms are therefore encouraged to engage in the process and get their own LEI. Obtaining an LEI is easy. Registrants simply contact their preferred business partner from the list of LEI issuing organizations available on the GLEIF website.\n",

It supports \" [multiple applications](https://ufscommunity.org/science/aboutapps/)\" with different forecast durations and spatial domains. The UFS Short-Range Weather (SRW) Application figures among these applications. It targets predictions of atmospheric behavior on a limited spatial domain and on time scales from minutes to several days. The SRW Application includes a prognostic atmospheric model, pre-processor, post-processor, and community workflow for running the system end-to-end. The \"[SRW Application Users's Guide](https://ufs-srweather-app.readthedocs.io/en/develop/)\" includes information on these components and provides detailed instructions on how to build and run the SRW Application. Users can access additional technical support via the \"[UFS GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/ufs-community/ufs-srweather-app/discussions/categories/q-a)\" <br/> <br/> This data registry contains the data required to run the “out-of-the-box” SRW Application case. The SRW App requires numerous input files to run, including static datasets (fix files containing climatological information, terrain and land use data), initial condition data files, lateral boundary condition data files, and model configuration files (such as namelists). The SRW App experiment generation system also contains a set of workflow end-to-end (WE2E) tests that exercise various configurations of the system (e.g., different grids, physics suites). Data for running a subset of these WE2E tests are also included within this registry. <br/> <br/> Users can generate forecasts for dates not included in this data registry by downloading and manually adding raw model files for the desired dates. Many of these model files are publicly available and can be accessed via links on the \"[Developmental Testbed Center](https://dtcenter.org/nwp-containers-online-tutorial/publicly-available-data-sets)\" website.",

Each file provides monthly values in a 5x5 lat/lon grid for the Continental United States. Data is available from 1895 to the present. On an annual basis, approximately one year of \"final\" nClimGrid will be submitted to replace the initially supplied \"preliminary\" data for the same time period. Users should be sure to ascertain which level of data is required for their research.\n<br/>\n<br/>\nEpiNOAA is an analysis ready dataset that consists of a daily time-series of nClimGrid measures (maximum temperature, minimum temperature, average temperature, and precipitation) at the county scale.  Each file provides daily values for the Continental United States. Data are available from 1951 to the present. Daily data are updated every 3 days with a preliminary data file and replaced with the scaled (i.e., quality controlled) data file every three months. This derivative data product is an enhancement from the original daily nClimGrid dataset in that all four weather parameters are now packaged into one file and assembled in a daily time-series format. In addition to a direct download option, an R package and web interface has been developed to streamline access to the final data product. These options allow end users three separate access modes to arrive at a customized dataset unique to each end user’s application. Users should be sure to review the data documentation to inform which level of data is required for their research.\n",

Alternate levels of correction are\npossible (systematic terrain, systematic, or precision) for scenes acquired at night or that\notherwise represent a reduced quality ground image (e.g., cloud cover).\n\nEach AST_L1T granule is converted into three different COG files based on the sensor and spatial resolution,\nVNIR at 15m, SWIR at 30m and TIR at 90m.

These rovers can collect rock and soil samples and can take measurements that can be used to determine their chemical makeup. <br/><br/>\nBecause communication between rovers and Earth is severely constrained, with limited transfer rates and short daily communication windows, scientists have a limited time to analyze the data and make difficult inferences about the chemistry in order to prioritize the next operations and send those instructions back to the rover. <br/><br/>\nThis project aimed at building a model to automatically analyze gas chromatography mass spectrometry (GCMS) data collected for Mars exploration in order to help the scientists in their analysis of understanding the past habitability of Mars. <br/><br/>\nMore information are available at https://mars.nasa.gov/msl/spacecraft/instruments/sam/ and the data from Mars are available and described at https://pds-geosciences.wustl.edu/missions/msl/sam.htm. <br/><br/>\n\nWe request that you cite the following ackowledgement when using the data provided from this NASA Project: \"NASA provided support for the development of SAM.

Additional information on the event and dataset can be found [here](https://earth.jaxa.jp/en/earthview/2023/02/14/7381/index.html). The 25 m PALSAR-2 ScanSAR is normalized backscatter data of PALSAR-2 broad area observation mode with observation width of 350 km. Polarization data are stored as 16-bit digital numbers (DN). The DN values can be converted to gamma naught values in decibel unit (dB) using the following equation: γ0 = 10*log10(DN2) - 83.0 dB. Included in this dataset are ALOS PALSAR Level 1.1 and 2.1 data. Level 1.1 is range and single look azimuth compressed data represented by complex I and Q channels to preserve the magnitude and phase information. Range coordinate is in slant range. In the case of ScanSAR mode, an image file is generated per each scan. Level 2.1 data is orthorectified from level 1.1 data by using digital elevation model. Pixel spacing is selectable depending on observation modes. Image coordinate in map projection is geocoded.\n",

The mosaic DEM tiles are assembled from multiple strip DEMs with the intention of providing a more consistent and comprehensive product over large areas. ArcticDEM data is constructed from in-track and cross-track high-resolution (~0.5 meter) imagery acquired by the Maxar constellation of optical imaging satellites.",

    "Description": "The University of Wisconsin Probabilistic Downscaling (UWPD) is a statistically downscaled dataset based on the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) climate models. UWPD consists of three variables, daily precipitation and maximum and minimum temperature. The spatial resolution is 0.1<span>&#176;</span>x0.1<span>&#176;</span> degree resolution for the United States and southern Canada east of the Rocky Mountains.\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThe downscaling methodology is not deterministic. Instead, to properly capture unexplained variability and extreme events, the methodology predicts a spatially and temporally varying Probability Density Function (PDF) for each variable. Statistics such as the mean, mean PDF and annual maximum statistics can be calculated directly from the daily PDF and these statistics are included in the dataset. In addition, “standard”, “raw” data is created by randomly sampling from the PDFs to create a “realization” of the local scale given the large-scale from the climate model. There are 3 realizations for temperature and 14 realizations for precipitation.\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThe directory structure of the data is as follows\n<br/>\n<code>[cmip_version]/[scenario]/[climate_model]/[ensemble_member]/</code>\n<br/>\nThe realizations are as follows\n<br/>\n<code>prcp_[realization_number]_[year].nc</code>\n<code>temp_[realization_number]_[year].nc</code>\n<br/>\nThe time mean files averaged over certain year bounds are as follows\n<br/>\n<code>prcp_mean_[year_bound_1]_[year_bound_2].nc</code>\n<code>temp_mean_[year_bound_1]_[year_bound_2].nc</code>\n<br/>\nThe time-mean Cumulative Distribution Function (CDF) files are as follows\n<br/>\n<code>prcp_cdf_[year_bound_1]_[year_bound_2].nc</code>\n<code>temp_cdf_[year_bound_1]_[year_bound_2].nc</code>\n<br/>\nThe CDF of the annual maximum precipitation is given for each year in the record\n<code>prcp_annual_max_cdf_[start_year_of_scenario]_[end_year_of_scenario].nc</code>\n<br />\n",

    "Description": "IMOS Ship of Opportunity Underway Expendable Bathythermographs (XBT) group is a research and data collection project working within the IMOS Ship of Opportunity Multi-Disciplinary Underway Network sub-facility. Five major (HRX) high-resolution XBT lines provide boundary to boundary profiling and closely spaced sampling to resolve mesoscale eddies, fronts and boundary currents. The lines are repeated 4 times per year by an on-board technician. The routes sample each major boundary current system using available commercial vessel traffic. All of the transects transmit data in real-time. The data represented by this record are presented in delayed mode. This SOOP dataset covers the Indian Ocean, Southern Ocean and Pacific Oceans.",

    "Name": "Satellite - Ocean Colour - MODIS - 1 day - Net Primary Productivity (GSM model and Eppley-VGPM algorithm)",
    "Description": "The Aqua satellite platform carries a MODIS sensor that observes sunlight reflected from within the ocean surface layer at multiple wavelengths. These multi-spectral measurements are used to infer the concentration of chlorophyll-a (Chl-a), most typically due to phytoplankton, present in the water. Modelling is then used to compute an estimate of the Net Primary Productivity (NPP).\n\nThe model used is based on the standard vertically generalised production model (VGPM).  The VGPM is a \"chlorophyll-based\" model that estimates net primary production from chlorophyll using a temperature-dependent description of chlorophyll-specific        photosynthetic efficiency. For the VGPM, net primary production is a function of chlorophyll, available light, and the photosynthetic efficiency. The only difference between the Standard VGPM and the Eppley-VGPM is the temperature-dependent description of photosynthetic efficiencies, with the Eppley approach using an exponential function to account for variation in photosynthetic efficiencies due to photoacclimation. The similarity between these models (VGPM vs E_VGPM) is described more extensively in a paper by Elena-Carr et al (2006.). VGPM is a Depth Integrated Model(DIM) described by Behrenfeld and Falkowski (1997), with modification due to Eppley (1972) as implemented by Antoine and Morel (1996).\n\nThere are multiple retrieval algorithms for estimating Chl-a. These data (eppley_npp_chl_gsm) use the Garver-Siegel-Maritorena (GSM) method implemented in the SeaDAS processing software l2gen and described in “Chapter 11, and references therein, of IOCCG Report 5, 2006, (http://ioccg.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/ioccg-report-05.pdf). This product is recommended for use in the VGPM model. The product Eppley_NPP_chl_gsm is experimental, in the sense that it is challenging to validate due to the scarcity of insitu measurments. It should only be used with caution informed by understanding of the algorithms.",

In the context of cancer this might involve the identification of specific mutations shown to predict response to a targeted therapy. The biomedical literature describing these associations is large and growing rapidly. Currently these interpretations exist largely in private or encumbered databases resulting in extensive repetition of effort. Realizing precision medicine will require this information to be centralized, debated and interpreted for application in the clinic. CIViC is an open access, open source, community-driven web resource for Clinical Interpretation of Variants in Cancer. Our goal is to enable precision medicine by providing an educational forum for dissemination of knowledge and active discussion of the clinical significance of cancer genome alterations.",

Lymph node metastases are extremely important to find, as they indicate that the cancer is no longer localized and systemic treatment might be warranted. Searching for these metastases in H&E-stained tissue is difficult and time-consuming and AI algorithms can play a role in helping make this faster and more accurate.\n",

    "Description": "GEOGLOWS is the Group on Earth Observation's Global Water Sustainability Program. It coordinates efforts from public \nand private entities to make application ready river data more accessible and sustainably available to underdeveloped \nregions. The GEOGLOWS Hydrological Model provides a retrospective and daily forecast of global river discharge at 7 \nmillion river sub-basins. The stream network is a hydrologically conditioned subset of the TDX-Hydro streams and \nbasins data produced by the United State's National Geospatial Intelligence Agency. The daily forecast provides 3 \nhourly average discharge in a 51 member ensemble and 15 day lead time derived from the ECMWF Integrated Forecast \nSystem (IFS). The retrospective simulation is derived from ERA5 climate reanalysis data and provides daily average \nstreamflow beginning on 1 January 1940. New forecasts are uploaded daily and the retrospective simulation is updated \nweekly on Sundays to keep the lag time between 5 and 12 days.<br><br>\nThe geoglows-v2 bucket contains: (1) model configuration files used to generate the simulations, (2) the GIS streams \ndatasets used by the model, (3) the GIS streams datasets optimized for visualizations used by Esri's Living Atlas \nlayer, (4) several supporting table of metadata including country names, river names, hydrological properties used for\nmodeling.<br><br>\nThe geoglows-v2-forecasts bucket contains: (1) daily 15 forecasts in zarr format optimized for time series queries of \nall ensemble members in the prediction, (2) CSV formatted summary files optimized for producing time series animated \nweb maps for the entire global streams dataset.<br><br>\nThe geoglows-v2-retrospective bucket contains: (1) the model retrospective outputs in (1a) zarr format optimized for \ntime series queries of up to a few hundred rivers on demand as well as (1b) in netCDF format best for bulk downloading \nthe dataset, (2) estimated return period flows for all 7 million million rivers (2a) in zarr format optimized for \nreading subsets of the dataset as well as (2b) in netCDF format best for bulk downloading. (3) The initialization files \nproduced at the end of each incremental simulation useful for restarting the model from a specific date.\n",

    "Description": "MultiCoNER 1 is a large multilingual dataset (11 languages) for Named Entity Recognition. It is designed to represent some of the contemporary challenges in NER, including low-context scenarios (short and uncased text), syntactically complex entities such as movie titles, and long-tail entity distributions. MultiCoNER 2 is a large multilingual dataset (12 languages) for fine grained Named Entity Recognition. Its fine-grained taxonomy contains 36 NE classes, representing real-world challenges for NER, where named entities, apart from the surface form, context represents a critical role in distinguishing between the different fine-grained types (e.g. Scientist vs. Athlete). Furthermore, the test data of MultiCoNER 2 contains noisy instances, where the noise has been applied to both context tokens as well as the entity tokens. The noise includes typing errors at character level based on keyboard layouts in the the different languages.\n",

    "Name": "Sentinel-1 SLC dataset for Germany",
    "Description": "The Sentinel1 Single Look Complex (SLC) unzipped dataset contains Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data from the European Space Agency’s Sentinel-1 mission. Different from the zipped data provided by ESA, this dataset allows direct access to individual swaths required for a given study area, thus drastically minimizing the storage and downloading time requirements of a project. Since the data is stored on S3, users can utilize the boto3 library and s3 get_object method to read the entire content of the object into the memory for processing, without actually having to download it. The Sentinel-1 constellation consists of two satellites equipped with SAR sensors and a combined revisit time of six days. SAR imagery gets recorded regardless of weather conditions and daylight, which makes it ideally suited for monitoring land-use changes, surface deformations, land applications, oil spills, sea-ice, natural hazards, and for emergency response. In its current first stage, the dataset covers the entirety of Germany and is being updated continuously. As a next stage, the dataset will provide up-to-date coverage of the sentinel-1 SLC data over Europe.\nThis dataset is retrieved from Alaska Satellite Facility (ASF) and consists of all Sentinel1-SLC imagery from the beginning (2014) to present.\n",

TIGER is the first challenge on fully automated assessment of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) in breast cancer histopathology slides. TILs are proving to be an important biomarker in cancer patients as they can play a part in killing tumor cells, particularly in some types of breast cancer. Identifying and measuring TILs can help to better target treatments, particularly immunotherapy, and may result in lower levels of other more aggressive treatments, including chemotherapy.\"\n",

    "Name": "1000 Genomes Phase 3 Reanalysis with DRAGEN 3.5, 3.7, 4.0, and 4.2",
    "Description": "This dataset contains alignment files and short nucleotide, copy number (CNV), repeat expansion (STR), structural variant (SV) and other variant call files from the 1000 Genomes Project Phase 3 dataset (n=3202) using Illumina DRAGEN v3.5.7b, v3.7.6, v4.0.3, and v4.2.7 software. All DRAGEN analyses were performed in the cloud using the Illumina Connected Analytics bioinformatics platform powered by Amazon Web Services (see 'Data solution empowering population genomics' for more information).  The v3.7.6 and v4.2.7 datasets include results from trio small variant, de novo structural variant and de novo copy number variant calls on 602 trio families comprised of members from the 1000 Genomes Project Phase 3 dataset. Trio repeat expansion calling was included in the v3.7.6 dataset only.  Joint cohort analysis was also performed on the entire 1KGP sample dataset (n=3202) for the v3.7.6, v4.0.3, and v4.2.7 reanalyses using DRAGEN GVCF Genotyper v3.8.3, v4.2.0, and v4.2.7, respectively (see 'Genotyping variants at population scale using DRAGEN gVCF Genotyper').  Improvements and new features in the v3.7.6 individual samples analyses include CYP2D6 variant calling and joint detection (see ‘DRAGEN 3.7 User Guide’ for details on these features) and use of graph-based hg19 and hg38 reference hash tables (see ‘DRAGEN Wins at PrecisionFDA Truth Challenge V2 Showcase Accuracy Gains from Alt-aware Mapping and Graph Reference Genomes’ and 'Demystifying the versions of GRCh38/hg38 reference genomes, how they are used in DRAGEN and their impact on accuracy' for details).  The DRAGEN v4.0.3 dataset features improved small variant calling accuracy due to utilization of a newly integrated machine learning functionality with an updated graph based reference for difficult to map regions (see ‘DRAGEN Sets New Standard for Data Accuracy in PrecisionFDA Benchmark Data. Optimizing Variant Calling Performance with Illumina Machine Learning and DRAGEN Graph’); accuracy and runtime improvements in the SV caller; new targeted callers including CYP2B6, GBA, SMN and a Star Allele PGx caller; and an expanded catalog for use with Expansion Hunter STR caller (see 'DRAGEN v4.0.3 Software Release Notes' for details on these and other new features and improvements).  DRAGEN v4.2 offers significant accuracy improvements in small variant, CNV, and SV calling, includes new targeted callers (HBA, LPA, RH, CYP21A2, SMN silent carrier variant), and supports star allele calling for 5 additional pharmacogenes (BCHE, ABCG2, NAT2, F5, UGT2B17).  See 'DRAGEN v4.2.4 Software Release Notes' for details about these and other new features and improvements for v4.2.  Starting with the v4.0.3 reanalysis, annotation using the Illumina Annotation Engine (Nirvana) was included as part of the analysis (see 'Nirvana Documentation' for more information).  In both the v4.0.3 and v4.2.7 datasets, annotation was performed on the merged small variant VCF generated by the DRAGEN GVCF Genotyper for the entire 1KGP cohort.  For v4.2.7, annotation was also performed on the CNV, SV, and STR VCFs for the entire cohort.  For these, individual VCFs generated by the DRAGEN CNV, SV, or STR caller for all samples in the cohort were merged into one VCF prior to performing annotation.",

    "Description": "The Observational Products for End-Users from Remote Sensing Analysis (OPERA) Coregistered Single-Look Complex (CSLC) from Sentinel-1 validated product consists of Single Look Complex (SLC) images which contain both amplitude and phase information of the complex radar return. The amplitude is primarily determined by ground surface properties (e.g., terrain slope, surface roughness, and physical properties), and phase primarily represents the distance between the radar and ground targets corrected for the geometrical distance between the two based on the knowledge from Digital Elevation Model and platform’s position, i.e., the CSLC phase represents residual geometrical distance between the sensor and target, the atmospheric propagation delay and the target movements. The CSLC-S1 product is derived from Copernicus Sentinel-1A and Sentinel-1B Interferometric Wide (IW) SLC data.  \n\nThe CSLC images are precisely aligned or “coregistered” to a pre-defined UTM/Polar stereographic map projection systems and posted at 5x10 m spacing in east and north direction, respectively.  Each CSLC-S1 product corresponds to a single S1 burst and is distributed as a Hierarchical Data Format version 5 (HDF5) file following the CF-1.8 convention containing both data raster layers (e.g., geocoded complex backscatter, low-resolution correction look-up tables) and product metadata. OPERA CSLC-S1 products are available over North America which includes the USA and U.S. Territories, Canada within 200 km of the U.S. border, and all mainland countries from the southern U.S. border down to and including Panama.  The OPERA CSLC-S1 product contains modified Copernicus Sentinel data (2016-2025).\n\nDue to the S1 mission’s narrow orbital tube, radar-geometry layers vary slightly over time for each position on the ground, and therefore are considered static. These static layers are provided separately from the OPERA CLSLC-S1 product, as they are produced only once or a limited number of times. The static layers are available in the associated OPERA Coregistered Single-Look Complex from Sentinel-1 Static Layers validated product (Version 1).\nRead our doc on how to get AWS Credentials to retrieve this data: https://cumulus.asf.alaska.edu/s3credentialsREADME",

The mosaic DEM tiles are assembled from multiple strip DEMs with the intention of providing a more consistent and comprehensive product over large areas.

Please see Public Notice at (https://www.weather.gov/media/notification/pdf_2023_24/pns24-12_rtofs_v2.4.0.pdf)<br /><br />\n\nNOAA's Global Real-Time Ocean Forecast System (Global RTOFS) provides users with nowcasts (analyses of near present conditions) and forecast guidance up to eight days of ocean temperature and salinity, water velocity, sea surface elevation, sea ice coverage and sea ice thickness. <br /><br />\n\nThe Global Operational Real-Time Ocean Forecast System (Global RTOFS) is based on an eddy resolving 1/12° global HYCOM (HYbrid Coordinates Ocean Model) (https://www.hycom.org/), which is coupled to the Community Ice CodE (CICE) Version 4 (https://www.arcus.org/witness-the-arctic/2018/5/highlight/1). The RTOFS grid has a 1/12 degree horizontal resolution and 41 hybrid vertical levels on a global tripolar grid. <br /><br />\n\nSince 2020, the RTOFS system implements a multivariate, multi-scale 3DVar data assimilation algorithm (Cummings and Smedstad, 2014) using a 24-hour update cycle. The data types presently assimilated include <br /><br />\n\n(1) satellite Sea Surface Temperature (SST) from METOP-B, JPSS-VIIRS, and  in-Situ SST, from ships, fixed and drifting buoys <br />\n(2) Sea Surface Salinity (SSS) from SMAP, SMOS, and buoys <br />\n(3) profiles of Temperature and Salinity from Animal-borne, Alamo floats, Argo floats, CTD, fixed buoys, gliders, TESAC, and XBT <br />\n(4) Absolute Dynamic Topography (ADT) from Altika, Cryosat, Jason-3, Sentinel 3a, 3b, 6a <br />\n(5) sea ice concentration from SSMI/S, AMSR2 <br /> <br />\n\nThe system is designed to incorporate new observing systems as the data becomes available. <br /> <br />\n\nOnce the observations go through a fully automated quality control and thinning process, the increments, or corrections, are obtained by executing the 3D variational algorithm. The increments are then added to the 24-hours forecast fields using a 6-hourly incremental analysis update. An earlier version of the system is described in Garraffo et al (2020). <br /> <br />\n\nGarraffo, Z.D., J.A. Cummings, S. Paturi, Y. Hao, D. Iredell, T. Spindler, B. Balasubramanian, I. Rivin, H-C.

    "Name": "NOAA Analysis of Record for Calibration (AORC) Dataset",
    "Description": "The Analysis Of Record for Calibration (AORC) is a gridded record of near-surface  weather conditions covering the continental United States and Alaska and their  hydrologically contributing areas. It is defined on a latitude/longitude spatial grid with a mesh length of 30 arc seconds (~800 m), and a temporal resolution of one hour.  Elements include hourly total precipitation, temperature, specific humidity, terrain-level  pressure, downward longwave and shortwave radiation, and west-east and south-north wind components. It spans the period from 1979 across the Continental U.S. (CONUS) and from 1981 across Alaska, to the near-present (at all locations). This suite of eight variables is sufficient to drive most land-surface and hydrologic models and is used as input to the National Water Model (NWM) retrospective simulation. While the native AORC process generates netCDF output, the data is post-processed to create a cloud optimized Zarr formatted equivalent for dissemination using cloud technology and infrastructure.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n**AORC Version 1.1 dataset creation**\n<br/>\nThe AORC dataset was created after reviewing, identifying, and processing multiple large-scale, observation, and analysis datasets. There are two versions of The Analysis Of Record for Calibration (AORC) data.\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThe initial AORC Version 1.0 dataset was completed in November 2019 and consisted of a grid with 8 elements at a resolution of 30 arc seconds.  The AORC version 1.1 dataset was created to address issues \"[see Table 1 in Fall et al., 2023](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1752-1688.13143)\" in the version 1.0 CONUS dataset. Full documentation on version 1.1 of the AORC data and the related journal publication are provided below.\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThe native AORC version 1.1 process creates a dataset that consists of netCDF files with the following dimensions: 1 hour, 4201 latitude values (ranging from 25.0 to 53.0), and 8401 longitude values (ranging from -125.0 to -67).\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThe data creation runs with a 10-day lag to ensure the inclusion of any corrections to the input Stage IV and NLDAS data.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n**Note** - The full extent of the AORC grid as defined in its data files exceed those cited above; those outermost rows and columns of data grids are filled with missing values and are the remnant of an early set of required AORC extents that have since been adjusted inward.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n**AORC Version 1.1 Zarr Conversion**\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThe goal for converting the AORC data from netCDF to Zarr was to allow users to quickly and efficiently load/use the data.  For example, one year of data takes 28 mins to load via NetCDF while only taking 3.2 seconds to load via Zarr (resulting in a substantial increase in speed).  For longer periods of time, the percentage increase in speed using Zarr (vs NetCDF) is even higher.  Using Zarr also leads to less memory and CPU utilization.\n<br/>\n<br/>\nIt was determined that the optimal conversion for the data was 1 year worth of Zarr files with a chunk size of 18MB. The chunking was completed across all 8 variables.  The chunks consist of the following dimensions: 144 time, 128 latitude, and 256 longitude. To create the files in the Zarr format, the NetCDF files were rechunked using chunk() and \"[Xarray](https://docs.xarray.dev/en/stable/)\".  After chunking the files, they were converted to a monthly Zarr file. Then, each monthly Zarr file was combined using \"[to_zarr](https://docs.xarray.dev/en/latest/generated/xarray.Dataset.to_zarr.html)\" to create a Zarr file that represents a full year\n<br/>\n<br/>\nUsers wanting more than 1 year of data will be able to utilize Zarr utilities/libraries to combine multiple years up to the span of the full data set.\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are eight variables representing the meteorological conditions\n<br/>\n**Total Precipitaion (APCP_surface)**\n<br/>\n1) Hourly total precipitation (kgm-2 or mm)  for Calibration (AORC) dataset\n<br/>\n**Air Temperature (TMP_2maboveground)**\n1) Temperature (at 2 m above-ground-level (AGL)) (K)\n<br/>\n**Specific Humidity (SPFH_2maboveground)**\n<br/>\n1) Specific humidity (at 2 m AGL) (g g-1) \n<br/>\n**Downward Long-Wave Radiation Flux (DLWRF_surface)**\n<br/>\n1) longwave (infrared)\n2) radiation flux (at the  surface) (W m-2) \n<br/>\n**Downward Short-Wave Radiation Flux (DSWRF_surface)**\n<br/>\n1) Downward shortwave (solar)\n2) radiation flux (at the  surface) (W m-2)\n<br/>\n**Pressure (PRES_surface)**\n<br/>\n1) Air pressure (at the surface) (Pa)\n<br/>\n**U-Component of Wind (UGRD_10maboveground)\"\n<br/>\n1)U (west-east) - components of the wind (at 10 m AGL) (m s-1)\n<br/>\n**V-Component of Wind (VGRD_10maboveground)\"\n<br/>\n1) V (south-north) - components of the wind (at 10 m AGL) (m s-1)\n<br/>\n<br/>\n**Precipitation and Temperature**\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThe gridded AORC precipitation dataset contains one-hour Accumulated Surface Precipitation (APCP) ending at the “top” of each hour, in liquid water-equivalent units  (kg m-2 to the nearest 0.1 kg m-2), while the gridded AORC temperature dataset is comprised of instantaneous, 2 m above-ground-level (AGL) temperatures at the top of each hour (in Kelvin, to the nearest 0.1).\n<br/>\n<br/>\n**Specific Humidity, Pressure, Downward Radiation, Wind**\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThe development process for the six additional dataset components of the Conus AORC [i.e., specific humidity at 2m above ground (kg kg-1); downward  longwave and shortwave radiation fluxes at the surface (W m-2); terrain-level pressure (Pa); and west-east and south-north wind components at 10 m above ground (m s-1)] has  two distinct periods, based on datasets and methodology applied: 1979–2015 and 2016–present. \n",

The de-identified dataset contains rich metadata, such as weather and semantic segmentation, and spans all four seasons, rain, snow, overcast and sunny days, different times of day, and a variety of traffic conditions.\n<br/>\nThe Aurora Multi-Sensor Dataset contains data from a 64-beam Velodyne HDL-64E LiDAR sensor and seven 1920x1200-pixel resolution cameras including a forward-facing stereo pair and five wide-angle lenses covering a 360-degree view around the vehicle.\n<br/>\nThis data can be used to develop and evaluate large-scale long-term approaches to autonomous vehicle localization. Its size and diversity make it suitable for a wide range of research areas such as 3D reconstruction, virtual tourism, HD map construction, and map compression, among others.\n<br/>\nThe data was first presented at the International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS) in 2020, where it was nominated as a Finalist for Best Application Paper at the conference.\n",

The Ningaloo Reef is one of the longest and most pristine reefs in the world. The reef is rich in marine biodiversity, with shark whales, turtles and fish aggregations, and high primary and secondary productions which are controlled by the physical oceanographic processes.  \n\nThe NWA HF ocean radar is a WERA phased array system with 12-element receive arrays located at the Jurabi Turtle Centre (21.8068 S, 114.1015 E) and Point Billie (22.5432 S, 113.690 E).  These radars operate at a frequency of 5.2625 MHz, with a bandwidth of 25 KHz and a maximum range of 200 Km.  Within the HF radar coverage area surface currents are measured.  Data are also collected from which wind directions and significant wave height can be calculated.",

    "Name": "Ocean Radar - South Australian gulfs site - Sea water velocity - Delayed mode",
    "Description": "The South Australia Gulfs (SAG) HF ocean radar system covers the area of about 40,000 square kilometres bounded by Kangaroo Island to the east and the Eyre Peninsula to the north.  This is a dynamic region where warm water from the remnants of the Leeuwin current is moving from the west, and water with varying density is exchanging with Spencer Gulf and the Gulf of St Vincent.  Upwelling events occur from the deep ocean on the south side of the observation area.  This is a key ocean area for aquaculture and fishing, and is a major shipping thoroughfare.  The data from this HF ocean radar system link the dynamics of the Great Australian Bight to the Bonney Coast and on to Tasmania. \n\nSpecific research questions identified by the SA Node of IMOS are: What is the detailed connection between shelf currents and the Flinders Current to non-regional influences (e.g. Southern Ocean, WA)?  What is the nature of oceanic currents and processes (e.g. wave drift, mixing, eddies) that drive both winter and summer cross and along shelf exchange including the summertime upwelling systems and flushing of the gulfs?  How does the ocean circulation, wave drift, eddies and environmental variability affect the distribution of sediments, nutrients, the production of lower trophic levels\n(phytoplankton and zooplankton), the dispersal of larvae that underpin productive fisheries in the region and the effects of environment on aquaculture\n\nThe SAG HF ocean radar is a WERA phased array system with 16-element receive arrays located at Cape Wiles (34.943 S, 135.681 E) and Cape Spencer (35.294 S, 136.879 E).  These radars operate at a frequency of 8.512 MHz, with a bandwidth of 33 KHz and a maximum range of 200 Km.  Within the HF radar coverage area surface currents are measured.  Data are also collected from which wind directions and significant wave height can be calculated.  \n\nMost of the capital was contributed by the South Australia Research and Development Institute.",

    "Description": "Digital Earth Africa (DE Africa) provides free and open access to a copy of Landsat Collection 2 Level-2 products over Africa. These products are produced and provided by the United States Geological Survey (USGS).\nThe Landsat series of Earth Observation satellites, jointly led by USGS and NASA, have been continuously acquiring images of the Earth’s land surface since 1972. DE Africa provides data from Landsat 5, 7 and 8 satellites, including historical observations dating back to late 1980s and regularly updated new acquisitions.\nNew Level-2 Landsat 7 and Landsat 8 data are available after 15 to 27 days from acquisition. See Landsat Collection 2 Generation Timeline for details.\nUSGS Landsat Collection 2 was released early 2021 and offers improved processing, geometric accuracy, and radiometric calibration compared to previous Collection 1 products. The Level-2 products are endorsed by the Committee on Earth Observation Satellites (CEOS) to be Analysis Ready Data for Land (CARD4L)-compliant. This internationally recognized certification ensures these products have been processed to a minimum set of requirements and organized into a form that allows immediate analysis with a minimum of additional user effort and interoperability both through time and with other datasets.\n",

    "Description": "The Automated Segmentation of intracellular substructures in Electron Microscopy (ASEM) project provides deep learning models trained to segment structures in 3D images of cells acquired by Focused Ion Beam Scanning Electron Microscopy (FIB-SEM). Each model is trained to detect a single type of structure (mitochondria, endoplasmic reticulum, golgi apparatus, nuclear pores, clathrin-coated pits) in cells prepared via chemically-fixation (CF) or high-pressure freezing and freeze substitution (HPFS). You can use our open source pipeline to load a model and predict a class of sub-cellular structures in naive FIB-SEM cells images. If required, a fine-tuning procedure allows a model to be trained on a small amount of additional ground truth annotations to improve a prediction on a naive dataset. Together with the trained models, we also provide the training, validation and test datasets.",

    "Description": "The Multi-Year Reanalysis of Remotely Sensed Storms (MYRORSS) consists of radar reflectivity data run through the Multi-Radar, Multi-Sensor (MRMS) framework to create a three-dimensional radar volume on a quasi-Cartesian latitude-longitude grid across the entire contiguous United States. The radar reflectivity grid is also combined with hourly forecast model analyses to produce derived products such as echo top heights and hail size estimates. Radar Doppler velocity data was also processed into two azimuthal shear layer products. The source radar data was from the [NEXRAD Level-II archive](https://registry.opendata.aws/noaa-nexrad/) and the model analyses came from [NOAA's Rapid Update Cycle model](https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/has/HAS.FileAppRouter?datasetname=RUCANL130&subqueryby=STATION&applname=&outdest=FILE). Radar reflectivity was quality controlled to remove non-weather echoes and the data set was manually quality contolled to remove errors as revealed through inspection of daily accumulations of the hail size product and the azimuthal shear products. MYRORSS contains data from April 1998 through December 2011. The horizontal resolution is 0.01<span>&#176;</span> by 0.01<span>&#176;</span> and the vertical spacing is stretched where at the lowest levels the spacing is 250-m and at the top of the domain 1000-m. The radar data was merged at imperfect timesteps, though in general the temporal spacing is around 5-min. \n",

    "Description": "The research vessels (RV Cape Ferguson and RV Solander) of the Australian Institute of Marine Science (AIMS) routinely record along-track (underway) measurements of near-surface water temperature, salinity, chlorophyll (fluorescence) and turbidity (NTU) during scientific operations in the tropical waters of northern Australia, particularly the Great Barrier Reef (GBR). All data records include sampling time (UTC), position (Latitude, Longitude) and water depth (under keel). \n\nData are recorded at 10 second intervals. Data are measured with a Seabird SBE38 thermometer, Seabird SBE21 thermosalinograph and Wetlabs ECO-FLNTU-RT (optical sensor for chlorophyll fluorescence and turbidity). The turbidity data (NTU) are currently regarded as provisional in the absence of local validation due to intermittent bubble contamination. The sampling intakes are located at depths of 1.9m (RV Cape Ferguson) and 2.5m (RV Solander).\n\nThe data is used to inform spatial patchiness of these variables and for ongoing validation of satellite ocean temperature and ocean colour products.\n\nThe IMOS Ships of Opportunity, Sensors on Tropical Research Vessels sub-Facility was discontinued in June 2022. Sea surface temperature data collected by Australian Institute of Marine Science research vessels continues to be provided via the IMOS Ships of Opportunity, Sea Surface Temperature Sensors for Australian Vessels sub-Facility records on the AODN Portal. The near real time sea surface temperature data are quality controlled by the Australian Bureau of Meteorology and uploaded onto the Global Telecommunication System (GTS) for global dissemination to be used in real time sea surface temperature analyses and climate data records. Access to the additional data collected by the AIMS research vessels, is provided on the AIMS data repository here: https://apps.aims.gov.au/metadata/view/8af21108-c535-43bf-8dab-c1f45a26088c.",

    "Description": "NASA's Physical Sciences Research Program, along with its predecessors, has conducted significant fundamental and applied research in the physical sciences. The International Space Station (ISS) is an orbiting laboratory that provides an ideal facility to conduct long-duration experiments in the near absence of gravity and allows continuous and interactive research similar to Earth-based laboratories. This enables scientists to pursue innovations and discoveries not currently achievable by other means. NASA's Physical Sciences Research Program also benefits from collaborations with several of the ISS international partners—Europe, Russia, Japan, and Canada—and foreign governments with space programs, such as France, Germany and Italy. <br/><br/> In fulfillment of the Open Science model, NASA's Physical Sciences Research Program is pleased to offer the PSI data repository for physical science experiments performed in reduced-gravity environments such as the ISS, Space Shuttle flights, and Free-flyers. PSI also includes data from some related ground-based studies. The PSI system is accessible and open to the public. This provides the opportunity for researchers to data mine results from prior flight investigations, expanding on the research performed. This approach will allow numerous ground-based investigations to be conducted from one flight experiment’s data, exponentially increasing our body of knowledge. PSI is an Open Data initiative.",

These data represent a new resource for cell biology, reveal gene expression in poorly characterized cell populations, and allow for direct and controlled comparison of gene expression in cell types shared between tissues, such as T-lymphocytes and endothelial cells from different anatomical locations. Two distinct technical approaches were used for most organs: one approach, microfluidic droplet-based 3’-end counting, enabled the survey of thousands of cells at relatively low coverage, while the other, FACS-based full length transcript analysis, enabled characterization of cell types with high sensitivity and coverage. The cumulative data provide the foundation for an atlas of transcriptomic cell biology. See: https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-018-0590-4\n",

    "Description": "This is a single-sensor multi-satellite SSTfnd product for a 144 hour period, derived using observations from AVHRR instruments on all available NOAA polar-orbiting satellites.  It is provided as a 0.02deg x 0.02deg cylindrical equidistant projected map over the region 70°E to 170°W, 20°N to 70°S. Each grid cell contains the 144 hour average of all the highest available quality SSTs that overlap with that cell, weighted by the area of overlap.  The diagram at https://help.aodn.org.au/satellite-data-product-information/ indicates where this product fits within the GHRSST suite of NOAA/AVHRR products. The SSTfnd is derived by adding a constant 0.17 degC to the SSTskin observations after rejecting observations with low surface wind speeds (<6m/s by day and <2m/s at night) (see http://www.bom.gov.au/amoj/docs/2011/beggs.pdf). Matchups with buoy SSTfnd observations for the central date indicate typical 2014 biases of < 0.03 degC and standard deviations of 0.6 degC.

The primary objective of producing this dataset is to provide countries lacking a national mangrove monitoring system with first cut mangrove extent and change maps, to help safeguard against further mangrove forest loss and degradation.\nThe Global Mangrove Watch dataset (version 2) consists of a global baseline map of mangroves for 2010 and changes from this baseline for six epochs i.e. 1996, 2007, 2008, 2009, 2015 and 2016. Annual maps are planned from 2018 and onwards. The dataset can be used to identify mangrove ecosystems and monitor changes in mangrove extent. This is important in applications such as quantifying ‘blue carbon’, mitigating risks from natural disasters, and prioritising restoration activities. For more information on the Global Watch Mangrove product see the Global Mangrove Watch website.\n",

These airborne LiDAR acquisition projects may have been conducted by NRCan or by various partners. The LiDAR point cloud data is licensed under an [open government license](https://open.canada.ca/en/open-government-licence-canada) and has been incorporated into the National Elevation Data Strategy.\nPoint cloud files are distributed by LiDAR acquisition project without integration between projects.\nThe point cloud files are distributed using the compressed .LAZ / [Cloud Optimized Point Cloud (COPC)](https://copc.io/) format. The COPC open format is an octree reorganization of the data inside a .LAZ 1.4 file. It allows efficient use and visualization rendering via HTTP calls (e.g. via the web), while offering the capabilities specific to the compressed .LAZ format which is already well established in the industry. Point cloud files are therefore both downloadable for local use and viewable via URL links from a cloud computing environment.\nThe reference system used for all point clouds in the product is NAD83(CSRS), epoch 2010. The projection used is the UTM projection with the corresponding zone. Elevations are orthometric and expressed in reference to the Canadian Geodetic Vertical Datum of 2013 (CGVD2013).\n<br/> <br/>\nLe produit [Nuages de points lidar](https://ouvert.canada.ca/data/fr/dataset/7069387e-9986-4297-9f55-0288e9676947) fait partie de la Série CanÉlévation créée pour appuyer la [Stratégie nationale de données d’élévation](https://ressources-naturelles.canada.ca/carte-outils-publications/imagerie-satellitaire-donnees-elevation-photos-aeriennes/strategie-nationale-donnees-elevation) mise en oeuvre par Ressources naturelles Canada (RNCan).\nCe produit contient les nuages de points obtenus lors de divers projets d’acquisition par lidar aéroporté réalisés au Canada. Ces projets d’acquisition par lidar aéroporté peuvent avoir été réalisés par RNCan ou par divers partenaires. Les données de nuages de points lidar ont une licence de type [gouvernement ouvert](https://ouvert.canada.ca/fr/licence-du-gouvernement-ouvert-canada) et ont été intégrés à la Stratégie nationale de données d’élévation.\nLes fichiers de nuages de points sont distribués par projet d'acquisition et sans intégration entre les projets.\nLes fichiers de nuages de points sont distribués en format compressé .LAZ / [Cloud Optimized Point Cloud (COPC)](https://copc.io/). Le format ouvert COPC est une réorganisation en octree des données à l’intérieur même d’un fichier .LAZ 1.4. Il permet une utilisation et un rendu de visualisation efficace via des appels HTTP (ex : via le web), tout en offrant les capacités propres au format .LAZ compressé qui est déjà bien établi dans l’industrie. Les fichiers de nuages de points sont donc autant téléchargeables pour une utilisation locale que visualisables via des liens URL provenant d’un environnement infonuagique.\nLe système de référence utilisé pour tous les nuages de points du produit est le NAD83(SCRS), époque 2010. La projection utilisée est la projection UTM avec le fuseau correspondant. Les élévations sont orthométriques et exprimées par rapport au Système canadien de référence altimétrique de 2013 (CGVD2013).",

Sentinel-1 is a C-band Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) satellite constellation first launched in 2014 as part of the European Union's Copernicus Earth Observation programme. POD products are a necessary auxiliary input for nearly all Sentinel-1 data processing workflows. <br/><br/> This dataset is a mirror of the [Sentinel-1 Orbits](https://documentation.dataspace.copernicus.eu/Data/ComplementaryData/Additional.html#sentinel-1-orbits) dataset hosted in the Copernicus Data Space Ecosystem (CDSE). New files are added within 20 minutes of their publication to CDSE. This dataset includes two types of POD files: RESORB and POEORB. <ul> <li>RESORB POD files are restituted orbit files generated within 180 minutes from sensing time and published multiple times per day, with accuracy requirement of 10 cm in 2D RMS, but typically below 5 cm. RESORB products from the last 90 days are included in this dataset.</li> <br/> <li>POEORB POD files are precise orbit files generated with a timeliness of 20 days from sensing time and published once per day, with accuracy requirement of 5 cm in 3D RMS, but typically below 1 cm. Once available, these files supersede the RESORB products, as they contain the same data with better accuracy. POEORB products are available from the entire length of the Sentinel-1 mission.</li> </ul> For more information on the orbit products, see the [POD Sentinel-1 Products Specification](https://sentiwiki.copernicus.eu/web/s1-processing#S1Processing-PODSentinel-1ProductsSpecificationS1-Processing-POD-Sentinel-1-Products-Specification).\n",

    "Description": "The electrocardiogram (ECG) is a non-invasive representation of the electrical activity of the heart. Although the twelve-lead ECG is the standard diagnostic screening system for many cardiological issues, the limited accessibility of twelve-lead ECG devices provides a rationale for smaller, lower-cost, and easier to use devices. While single-lead ECGs are limiting [1], reduced-lead ECG systems hold promise, with evidence that subsets of the standard twelve leads can capture useful information [2], [3], [4] and even be comparable to twelve-lead ECGs in some limited contexts. In 2017 we challenged the public to classify AF from a single-lead ECG, and in 2020 we challenged the public to diagnose a much larger number of cardiac problems using twelve-lead recordings. However, there is limited evidence to demonstrate the utility of reduced-lead ECGs for capturing a wide range of diagnostic information.\n\nIn this year&rsquo;s Challenge, we ask the following question: &lsquo;Will two do?&rsquo; This year&rsquo;s Challenge builds on last year&rsquo;s Challenge [5], which asked participants to classify cardiac abnormalities from twelve-lead ECGs. We are asking you to build an algorithm that can classify cardiac abnormalities from twelve-lead, six-lead, four-lead, three-lead, and two-lead ECGs. We will test each algorithm on databases of these reduced-lead ECGs, and the differences in performances of the algorithms on these databases will reveal the utility of reduced-lead ECGs in comparison to standard twelve-lead EGCs.",

Along with the seven 500 meter (m) reflectance bands are two quality layers and four observation bands. For each pixel, a value is selected from all the acquisitions within the 8-day composite period. The criteria for the pixel choice include cloud and solar zenith. When several acquisitions meet the criteria the pixel with the minimum channel 3 (blue) value is used. \n\nKnown Issues\n* For complete information about known issues please refer to the [MODIS/VIIRS Land Quality Assessment website](https://landweb.modaps.eosdis.nasa.gov/knownissue?sensor=MODIS&sat=Terra&as=61).\n\nImprovements/Changes from Previous Versions\n* The Version 6.1 Level-1B (L1B) products have been improved by undergoing various calibration changes that include: changes to the response-versus-scan angle (RVS) approach that affects reflectance bands for Aqua and Terra MODIS, corrections to adjust for the optical crosstalk in Terra MODIS infrared (IR) bands, and corrections to the Terra MODIS forward look-up table (LUT) update for the period 2012 - 2017.\n* A polarization correction has been applied to the L1B Reflective Solar Bands (RSB).\nRead our doc on how to get AWS Credentials to retrieve this data: https://data.lpdaac.earthdatacloud.nasa.gov/s3credentialsREADME",

    "Description": "The Rapid Refresh Forecast System (RRFS) is the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s (NOAA) next generation convection-allowing, rapidly-updated ensemble prediction system, currently scheduled for operational implementation in 2026. The operational configuration will feature a 3 km grid covering North America and include deterministic forecasts every hour out to 18 hours, with deterministic and ensemble forecasts to 60 hours four times per day at 00, 06, 12, and 18 UTC.The RRFS will provide guidance to support forecast interests including, but not limited to, aviation, severe convective weather, renewable energy, heavy precipitation, and winter weather on timescales where rapidly-updated guidance is particularly useful.<br/><br/>\n\nThe RRFS is underpinned by the [Unified Forecast System (UFS)](https://ufscommunity.org/), a community-based Earth modeling initiative, and benefits from collaborative development efforts across NOAA, academia, and research institutions.<br/><br/>\n\nThis bucket provides access to real time, experimental RRFS prototype output.  And will provide access to final retrospective output once completed.<br/><br/>\n<hr/>\n\nThe real-time RRFS prototype is experimental and evolving. [<b> Real-time RRFS output will cease to be generated for several months beginning on ~3 December 2024.  This step is being taken to allow for final retrospective testing to be completed. </b>] It is not under 24x7 monitoring and is not operational. Output may be delayed or missing. Outputs will change. When significant changes to output take place, this description will be updated.<br/><br/>\n\nWe currently provide hourly deterministic forecasts at 3 km grid spacing out to 60 hours at 00, 06, 12, and 18 UTC, and out to 18 hours for other cycles. Output is organized by cycle date and cycle hour.\n\nFor example, `rrfs_a/rrfs_a.20241201/12/control` contains the deterministic forecast initialized at 12 UTC on 01 December 2024. Users will find two types of output in GRIB2 format. The first is:<br/><br/>\n`rrfs.t12z.natlev.f018.grib2` <br/><br/>\n\nMeaning that this is the RRFS_A initialized at 12 UTC, covers the full North America domain, and is the native level post-processed gridded data at hour 18.  This output is on a rotated latitude-longitude grid at 3 km grid spacing.<br/><br/>\n\nThe second output file in grib2 format is:<br/><br/>\n\n`rrfs.t12z.prslev.f018.conus.grib2` <br/><br/>\n\nThe “prslev” descriptor indicates that this post-processed gridded data is output on pressure levels. The “conus” descriptor indicates that it covers the contiguous United States\n\nFor users interested in other domains, output is provided on the full 3-km North American grid and also subset over Alaska, Hawaii, and Puerto Rico. The files are identified as follows: <br/><br/>\n\nNorth America: `rrfs.t00z.prslev.f002.grib2`\nAlaska: `rrfs.t00z.prslev.f002.ak.grib2`\nHawaii: `rrfs.t00z.prslev.f002.hi.grib2`\nPuerto Rico: `rrfs.t00z.prslev.f002.pr.grib2`\n\n<br/><br/>\n\nBeginning on December 8th, 2023 we now provide prototype RRFSv1 ensemble output and products. Output is available for 00, 06, 12, and 18 UTC cycles, and is organized by cycle date and cycle hour. For example, `rrfs_a/rrfs_a.20231214/00/mem0001` contains the forecast from member 1, and `rrfs_a/rrfs_a.20231214/00/enspost_timelag` contains the ensemble products.\n",

    "Description": "RarePlanes is a unique open-source machine learning dataset from CosmiQ Works and AI.Reverie that incorporates both real and synthetically generated satellite imagery. The RarePlanes dataset specifically focuses on the value of AI.Reverie synthetic data to aid computer vision algorithms in their ability to automatically detect aircraft and their attributes in satellite imagery. Although other synthetic/real combination datasets exist, RarePlanes is the largest openly-available very high resolution dataset built to test the value of synthetic data from an overhead perspective. The real portion of the dataset consists of 253 Maxar WorldView-3 satellite scenes spanning 112 locations and 2,142 km^2 with 14,700 hand-annotated aircraft. The accompanying synthetic dataset is generated via AI.Reverie’s novel simulation platform and features 50,000 synthetic satellite images with ~630,000 aircraft annotations.",

We have processed all land-ice intersecting image pairs separated by ≤546 days for optical and ≤12 for SAR sensors, for all missions from each mission start to the end of 2022.\nThe ITS_LIVE project will continue processing new optical and radar scene pairs as they come in, and will soon increase production to include SAR image pairs separated by more than 12 days. We also expect to extend processing to include ASTER, RADARSAT, and NISAR imagery. Further, all scene pair data are combined into a set of Zarr datacubes that are cloud-optimized for time-series analysis, with a suite of user tools available to query the data effectively.\nThe ITS_LIVE project is also producing a suite of Level 3 products, including quarterly and annual ice-sheet and regional velocity mosaics as Cloud-Optimized GeoTIFFs, standardized records of elevation change rates for Greenland and Antarctica, and ice shelf and tidewater glacier front positions.\nFor more information about the ITS_LIVE project, please see <https://its-live.jpl.nasa.gov/>.\n",

The data comprise both surface (2D) and volumetric (3D) variables in the atmosphere, ocean, land, and ice domains. The total data volume of the original dataset is ~500TB, which has traditionally been stored as ~150,000 individual CF/NetCDF files on disk or magnetic tape made available through the NCAR Climate Data Gateway for download or via web services.\n\n   NCAR has copied a subset (currently ~70 TB) of CESM LENS data to Amazon S3 as part of the AWS Public Datasets Program. To optimize for large-scale analytics we have represented the data as ~275 Zarr stores format accessible through the Python Xarray library. Each Zarr store contains a single physical variable for a given model run type and temporal frequency (monthly, daily, 6-hourly).\n",

    "Description": "This is a multi-sensor SSTfnd L3S product for a single 24 hour period, derived using sea surface temperature retrievals from the VIIRS sensor on the Suomi-NPP satellite and JPSS series of satellites, and AVHRR sensor on the NOAA and Metop series of Polar-orbiting satellites. The sensors and satellite platforms contributing to each file are listed in the sensor and platform global attributes in the file header. The SSTfnd is derived by adding a constant 0.17 degC to the NOAA AVHRR SSTskin observations, and 0 degC to the Metop and VIIRS SSTsubskin observations, after rejecting observations with low surface wind speeds (<6 m/s by day and <2 m/s at night). The Multi-sensor L3S product is provided as a 0.02deg x 0.02deg cylindrical equidistant projected map over the region 70E to 170W, 20N to 70S. The quality level for each pixel was remapped using the original ACSPO VIIRS and AVHRR L3U quality levels and Sensor Specific Error Statistics (SSES), as described in Griffin et al. (2017) Appendix at http://imos.org.au/facilities/srs/sstproducts/sstdata0/sstdata-references/, before compositing single swaths from the sensors. Each grid cell contains the 24 hour average of all the highest available quality SSTs that overlap with that cell, weighted by the area of overlap. Refer to the IMOS SST products web page at http://imos.org.au/sstproducts.html for further information.",

Normals act both as a ruler to compare today’s weather and tomorrow’s forecast, and as a predictor of conditions in the near future. The official normals are calculated for a uniform 30 year period, and consist of annual/seasonal, monthly, daily, and hourly averages and statistics of temperature, precipitation, and other climatological variables from almost 15,000 U.S. weather stations. <br/><br/>\nNCEI generates the official U.S. normals every 10 years in keeping with the needs of our user community and the requirements of the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) and National Weather Service (NWS). The 1991–2020 U.S. Climate Normals are the latest in a series of decadal normals first produced in the 1950s. These data allow travelers to pack the right clothes, farmers to plant the best crop varieties, and utilities to plan for seasonal energy usage. Many other important economic decisions that are made beyond the predictive range of standard weather forecasts are either based on or influenced by climate normals.\n",

    "Name": "NOAA Global Forecast System (GFS) netCDF Formatted Data",
    "Description": "The Global Forecast System (GFS) is a weather forecast model produced by the National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP). Dozens of atmospheric and land-soil variables are available through this dataset, from temperatures, winds, and precipitation to soil moisture and atmospheric ozone concentration. The GFS data files stored here can be immediately used for [OAR/ARL’s NOAA-EPA Atmosphere-Chemistry Coupler Cloud (NACC-Cloud) tool](https://www.arl.noaa.gov/research/surface-atmosphere-exchange-home/tools-and-products/nacc-nacc-cloud/), and are in a Network Common Data Form (netCDF), which is a very common format used across the scientific community. These particular GFS files contain a comprehensive number of global atmosphere/land variables at a relatively high spatiotemporal resolution (approximately 13x13 km horizontal, vertical resolution of 127 levels, and hourly), are not only necessary for the NACC-Cloud tool to adequately drive community air quality applications (e.g., U.S. EPA’s Community Multiscale Air Quality model; https://www.epa.gov/cmaq), but can be very useful for a myriad of other applications in the Earth system modeling communities (e.g., atmosphere, hydrosphere, pedosphere, etc.). While many other data file and record formats are indeed available for Earth system and climate research (e.g., GRIB, HDF, GeoTIFF), the netCDF files here are advantageous to the larger community because of the comprehensive, high spatiotemporal information they contain, and because they are more scalable, appendable, shareable, self-describing, and community-friendly (i.e., many tools available to the community of users).  Out of the four operational GFS forecast cycles per day (at 00Z, 06Z, 12Z and 18Z) this particular netCDF dataset is updated daily (/inputs/yyyymmdd/) for the 12Z cycle and includes 24-hr output for both 2D (gfs.t12z.sfcf$0hh.nc) and 3D variables (gfs.t12z.atmf$0hh.nc).\n<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso available are netCDF formatted Global Land Surface Datasets (GLSDs) developed by [Hung et al](https://repository.library.noaa.gov/view/noaa/65705). (2024).  The GLSDs are based on numerous satellite products, and have been gridded to match the GFS spatial resolution (~13x13 km).  These GLSDs contain vegetation canopy data (e.g., land surface type, vegetation clumping index, leaf area index, vegetative canopy height, and green vegetation fraction) that are supplemental to and can be combined with the GFS meteorological netCDF data for various applications, including [NOAA-ARL's canopy-app](https://github.com/noaa-oar-arl/canopy-app).  The canopy data variables are climatological, based on satellite data from the year 2020, combined with GFS meteorology for the year 2022, and are created at a daily temporal resolution (/inputs/geo-files/gfs.canopy.t12z.2022mmdd.sfcf000.global.nc)\n<br/>\n",

    "Description": "The Human Sleep Project (HSP) sleep physiology dataset is a growing collection of clinical polysomnography (PSG) recordings. Beginning with PSG recordings from from ~15K patients evaluated at the Massachusetts General Hospital, the HSP will grow over the coming years to include data from >200K patients, as well as people evaluated outside of the clinical setting. This data is being used to develop CAISR (Complete AI Sleep Report), a collection of deep neural networks,  rule-based algorithms, and signal processing approaches designed to provide better-than-human detection of conventional PSG scoring metrics, including sleep stages, arousals, apnea and hypopnea events and their subtypes, and periodic limb movements. Beyond conventional scoring, the HSP dataset is intended to support research seeking to identify \"hidden\" information within the brain's activity during sleep that can be used to directly measure brain health. These brain health indicators include measures of risk for common neurologic diseases, including cerebrovascular disease, and Alzheimer's disease and related neurodegenerative diseases of aging; and indicators of response to therapies, including lifestyle interventions (e.g. diet, meditation, exercise) and pharmacologic interventions. These data are shared via the BDSP (Brain Data Science Platform, a resource developed by an international coalition of investigators that aggregates and harmonizes a wide range of large-scale human clinical neuroscience data to support research aimed at improving diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of neurologic disease, and promotion of brain health. The summary data provided here are released for the benefit of the wider scientific community without restriction on use.",

    "Name": "GPM IMERG Late Precipitation L3 Half Hourly 0.1 degree x 0.1 degree V07 (GPM_3IMERGHHL) at GES DISC",
    "Description": "Version 07B is the current version of the IMERG data sets. Older versions\nwill no longer be available and have been superseded by Version 07.\\n\\nThe Integrated\nMulti-satellitE Retrievals for GPM (IMERG) is the unified U.S. algorithm that provides\nthe multi-satellite precipitation product for the U.S. GPM team.\\n\\nThe precipitation\nestimates from the various precipitation-relevant satellite passive microwave (PMW)\nsensors comprising the GPM constellation are computed using the 2021 version of\nthe Goddard Profiling Algorithm (GPROF2021), then gridded, intercalibrated to the\nGPM Combined Ku Radar-Radiometer Algorithm (CORRA) product, and merged into half-hourly\n0.1°x0.1° (roughly 10x10 km) fields. Note that CORRA is adjusted to the monthly\nGlobal Precipitation Climatology Project (GPCP) Satellite-Gauge (SG) product over\nhigh-latitude ocean to correct known biases.\\n\\nThe half-hourly intercalibrated\nmerged PMW estimates are then input to both a Morphing-Kalman Filter (KF) Lagrangian\ntime interpolation scheme based on work by the Climate Prediction Center (CPC) and\nthe Precipitation Estimation from Remotely Sensed Information using Artificial Neural\nNetworks (PERSIANN) Dynamic Infrared–Rain Rate (PDIR) re-calibration scheme. In\nparallel, CPC assembles the zenith-angle-corrected, intercalibrated merged geo-IR\nfields and forwards them to PPS for input to the PERSIANN-CCS algorithm (supported\nby an asynchronous re-calibration cycle) which are then input to the KF morphing\n(quasi-Lagrangian time interpolation) scheme.\\n\\nThe KF morphing (supported by an\nasynchronous KF weights updating cycle) uses the PMW and IR estimates to create\nhalf-hourly estimates. Motion vectors for the morphing are computed by maximizing\nthe pattern correlation of successive hours within each of the precipitation (PRECTOT),\ntotal precipitable liquid water (TQL), and vertically integrated vapor (TQV) data\nfields provided by the Modern-Era Retrospective Analysis for Research and Applications,\nVersion 2 (MERRA-2) and Goddard Earth Observing System model Version 5 (GEOS-5)\nForward Processing (FP) for the post-real-time (Final) Run and the near-real-time\n(Early and Late) Runs, respectively. The vectors from PRECTOT are chosen if available,\nelse from TQL, if available, else from TQV. The KF uses the morphed data as the\n“forecast” and the IR estimates as the “observations”, with weighting that depends\non the time interval(s) away from the microwave overpass time. The IR becomes important\nafter about ±90 minutes away from the overpass time. Variable averaging in the KF\nis accounted for in a routine (Scheme for Histogram Adjustment with Ranked Precipitation\nEstimates in the Neighborhood, or SHARPEN) that compares the local histogram of\nKF morphed precipitation to the local histogram of forward- and backward-morphed\nmicrowave data and the IR.\\n\\nThe IMERG system is run twice in near-real time:\\n\\n\\\"Early\\\"\nmulti-satellite product ~4 hr after observation time using only forward morphing\nand\\n\\\"Late\\\" multi-satellite product ~14 hr after observation time, using both\nforward and backward morphing\\nand once after the monthly gauge analysis is received:\\n\\n\\\"Final\\\",\nsatellite-gauge product ~4 months after the observation month, using both forward\nand backward morphing and including monthly gauge analyses.\\n\\nIn V07, the near-real-time\nEarly and Late half-hourly estimates have a monthly climatological concluding calibration\nbased on averaging the concluding calibrations computed in the Final, while in the\npost-real-time Final Run the multi-satellite half-hourly estimates are adjusted\nso that they sum to the Final Run monthly satellite-gauge combination. In all cases\nthe output contains multiple fields that provide information on the input data,\nselected intermediate fields, and estimation quality. In general, the complete calibrated\nprecipitation, precipitation, is the data field of choice for most users.\\n\\nPrecipitation\nphase is a diagnostic variable computed using analyses of surface temperature, humidity,\nand pressure. \\n\\n\\n\\nRead our doc on how to get AWS Credentials to retrieve this\ndata: https://data.gesdisc.earthdata.nasa.gov/s3credentialsREADME",

    "Description": "ANNOUNCEMENTS: [NOS OFS Version Updates and Implementation of Upgraded Oceanographic Forecast Modeling Systems for Lakes Superior and Ontario; Effective October 25, 2022}(https://www.weather.gov/media/notification/pdf2/scn22-91_nos_loofs_lsofs_v3.pdf)\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFor decades, mariners in the United States have depended on NOAA's Tide Tables for the best estimate of expected water levels. These tables provide accurate predictions of the astronomical tide (i.e., the change in water level due to the gravitational effects of the moon and sun and the rotation of the Earth); however, they cannot predict water-level changes due to wind, atmospheric pressure, and river flow, which are often significant.\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThe National Ocean Service (NOS) has the mission and mandate to provide guidance and information to support navigation and coastal needs. To support this mission, NOS has been developing and implementing hydrodynamic model-based [Operational Forecast Systems](https://tidesandcurrents.noaa.gov/forecast_info.html). \n<br/>\n<br/>\nThis forecast guidance provides oceanographic information that helps mariners safely navigate their local waters. This national network of hydrodynamic models provides users with operational nowcast and forecast guidance (out to 48 – 120 hours) on parameters such as water levels, water temperature, salinity, and currents. These forecast systems are implemented in critical ports, harbors, estuaries, Great Lakes and coastal waters of the United States, and form a national backbone of real-time data, tidal predictions, data management and operational modeling.\n<br/>\n<br/>\nNowcasts and forecasts are scientific predictions about the present and future states of water levels (and possibly currents and other relevant oceanographic variables, such as salinity and temperature) in a coastal area. These predictions rely on either observed data or forecasts from a numerical model. A nowcast incorporates recent (and often near real-time) observed meteorological, oceanographic, and/or river flow rate data. A nowcast covers the period from the recent past (e.g., the past few days) to the present, and it can make predictions for locations where observational data are not available. A forecast incorporates meteorological, oceanographic, and/or river flow rate forecasts and makes predictions for times where observational data will not be available. A forecast is usually initiated by the results of a nowcast.\n<br/>\n<br/>\nOFS generally runs four times per day (every 6 hours) on NOAA's Weather and Climate Operational Supercomputing Systems (WCOSS) in a standard Coastal Ocean Modeling Framework (COMF) developed by the [Center for Operational Oceanographic Products and Services (CO-OPS)](https://tidesandcurrents.noaa.gov/). COMF is a set of standards and tools for developing and maintaining NOS’s hydrodynamic model–based operational forecast systems. The goal of COMF is to provide a standard and comprehensive software infrastructure to enhance ease of use, performance, portability, and interoperability of NOS’s operational forecast systems.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n",

    "Description": "The Aqua satellite platform carries a MODIS sensor that observes sunlight reflected from within the ocean surface layer at multiple wavelengths. These multi-spectral measurements are used to infer the concentration of chlorophyll-a (Chl-a), most typically due to phytoplankton, present in the water. An empirical relationship is then used to compute an estimate of the relative abundance of three phytoplankton size classes (micro, nano and picoplankton). \n\nThe methods used to decompose chl_oc3 are described by Brewin et al in two papers in 2010 and 2012. The two methods, denoted Brewin2010at and Brewin2012in, used calibration data from the Atlantic and Indian Oceans respectively.  Users should note that these are unvalidated experimental products and they should familiarise themselves with the underlying algorithms and methodologies described in the published literature before making use of them.\n\nThe data are produced from the same data stream as the MODIS Chla_oc3 data set (https://catalogue-imos.aodn.org.au:443/geonetwork/srv/api/records/d7a14921-8f3f-4522-9a54-e7d1df969c8a). \n\nData are provided as two files per day, one with the percentage of nanoplankton, and one for picoplankton. The percentage of microplankton is computed as the balance to 100%, that is %micro = 100 - %nano - %pico.",

    "Name": "MODIS/Terra Calibrated Radiances 5-Min L1B Swath 500m",
    "Description": "The MODIS/Terra Calibrated Radiances 5Min L1B Swath 500m data set contains calibrated and geolocated at-aperture radiances for 7 discrete bands located in the 0.45 to 2.20 micron region of the electromagnetic spectrum. These data are generated from the MODIS Level 1A scans of raw radiance and in the process converted to geophysical units of W/(m^2 um sr). Additional data are provided including quality flags, error estimates and calibration data.\r\n\r\nVisible, shortwave infrared, and near infrared measurements are only made during the daytime (except band 26), while radiances for the thermal infrared region (bands 20-25, 27-36) are measured continuously.\r\n\r\nChannels 1 and 2 have 250 m resolution, channels 3 through 7 have 500 m resolution. However, for the MODIS L1B 500 m product, the 250 m band radiance data and their associated uncertainties have been aggregated to 500m resolution. Thus the entire channel data set has been co-registered to the same spatial scale in the 500 m product. Separate L1B products are available for the 250 m resolution channels (MOD02QKM) and 1 km resolution channels (MOD021KM). For the latter product, the 250 m and 500 m channel data (bands 1 through 7) have been aggregated into equivalent 1 km pixel values.\r\n            \r\nSpatial resolution for pixels at nadir is 500 km, degrading to 2.4 km in the along-scan direction at the scan extremes. However, thanks to the overlapping of consecutive swaths and respectively pixels there, the resulting resolution at the scan extremes is about 1 km. A 55 degree scanning pattern at the EOS orbit of 705 km results in a 2330 km orbital swath width and provides global coverage every one to two days. A single MODIS Level 1B 500 m granule will contain a scene built from 203 scans sampled 2708 times in the cross-track direction, corresponding to approximately 5 minutes worth of data; thus 288 granules will be produced per day. Since an individual MODIS scan will contain 20 along-track spatial elements for the 500 m channels, the scene will be composed of (2708 x 4060) pixels, resulting in a spatial coverage of (2330 km x 2040 km). Due to the MODIS scan geometry, there will be increasing scan overlap beyond about 20 degrees scan angle.      \r\n\r\nTo summarize, the MODIS L1B 500 m data product consists of:\r\n            \r\n1. Calibrated radiances, uncertainties and number of samples for (2) 250 m reflected solar bands aggregated to 500 m resolution\r\n            \r\n2. Calibrated radiances and uncertainties for (5) 500 m reflected solar bands\r\n            \r\n3. Geolocation for 1km pixels, that must be interpolated to get 500 m pixel locations. For the relationship of 1km pixels to 500m pixels, see the Geolocation ATBD https://modis.gsfc.nasa.gov/data/atbd/atbd_mod28_v3.pdf.\r\n            \r\n4. Calibration data for all channels (scale and offset) \r\n            \r\n5. Comprehensive set of file-level metadata summarizing the spatial, temporal and parameter attributes of the data, as well as auxiliary information pertaining to instrument status and data quality characterization users requiring all geolocation and solar/satellite geometry fields at 1km resolution can obtain the separate MODIS Level 1 Geolocation product (MOD03) from LAADS  https://ladsweb.modaps.eosdis.nasa.gov/ . \r\n            \r\nThe shortname for this product is MOD02HKM and is stored in the Earth Observing System Hierarchical Data Format (HDF-EOS). A typical MOD02HKM file size is approximately 135 MB.\r\n            \r\nEnvironmental information derived from MODIS L1B measurements will offer a comprehensive and unprecedented look at terrestrial, atmospheric, and ocean phenomenology for a wide and diverse community of users throughout the world.\r\n\r\nSee the MODIS Characterization Support Team webpage for more C6 product information at:\r\n\r\nhttps://mcst.gsfc.nasa.gov/l1b/product-information\r\n\r\n\r\nor visit Science Team homepage at:\r\nhttps://modis.gsfc.nasa.gov/data/dataprod/\nRead our doc on how to get AWS Credentials to retrieve this data: https://data.laadsdaac.earthdatacloud.nasa.gov/s3credentialsREADME",

    "Description": "The CSIRO Climate retrospective Analysis and Forecast Ensemble system: version 1 (CAFE60v1) provides a large ensemble retrospective analysis of the global climate system from 1960 to present with sufficiently many realizations and at spatio-temporal resolutions suitable to enable probabilistic climate studies. Using a variant of the ensemble Kalman filter, 96 climate state estimates are generated over the most recent six decades. These state estimates are constrained by monthly mean ocean, atmosphere and sea ice observations such that their trajectories track the observed state while enabling estimation of the uncertainties in the approximations to the retrospective mean climate over recent decades. Strongly coupled data assimilation (SCDA) is implemented via an ensemble transform Kalman filter in order to constrain a general circulation climate model to observations. Satellite (altimetry, sea surface temperature, sea ice concentration) and in situ ocean temperature and salinity profiles are directly assimilated each month, whereas atmospheric observations are sub-sampled from the JRA55 atmospheric reanalysis. Strong coupling is implemented via explicit cross domain covariances between ocean, atmosphere, sea ice and ocean biogeochemistry. Atmospheric and surface ocean fields are available at daily resolution and monthly resolution for the land, subsurface ocean and sea ice. The system also produces a complete data archive of initial conditions potentially enabling individual forecasts for all members each month over the 60 year period. The size of the ensemble and application of strongly coupled data assimilation lead to new insights for future reanalyses. CAFE60v1 has been validated in comparison to empirical indices of the major climate teleconnections and blocking from various reanalysis products (ERA5, JRA55, NCEP NR1). Estimates of the large scale ocean structure and transports have been compared to those derived from gridded observational products (WOA18, HadISST, ERSSTv5) and climate model projections (CMIP). Sea ice (extent, concentration and variability) and land surface (precipitation and surface air temperatures) are also compared to a variety of model (ERA5, CMIP) and observational (GPCP, AWAP, HadCRU4, GIOMAS, NSIDC, HadISST) products. This analysis shows that CAFE60v1 is a useful, comprehensive and unique data resource for studying internal climate variability and predictability, including the recent climate response to anthropogenic forcing on multi-year to decadal time scales.",

    "Description": "The 2020 Census Demographic and Housing Characteristics Noisy Measurement File is an intermediate output of the 2020 Census Disclosure Avoidance System (DAS) TopDown Algorithm (TDA) (as described in Abowd, J. et al [2022], and implemented in [primitives.py](https://github.com/uscensusbureau/DAS_2020_DHC_Production_Code/blob/main/das_decennial/programs/engine/primitives.py)). The 2020 Census Demographic and Housing Characteristics Noisy Measurement File includes zero-Concentrated Differentially Private (zCDP) (Bun, M. and Steinke, T [2016]) noisy measurements, implemented via the discrete Gaussian mechanism (Cannone C., et al., [2023] ), which added positive or negative integer-valued noise to each of the resulting counts. These are estimated counts of individuals and housing units included in the 2020 Census Edited File (CEF), which includes confidential data collected in the 2020 Census of Population and Housing.\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThe noisy measurements included in this file were subsequently post-processed by the TopDown Algorithm (TDA) to produce the Census Demographic and Housing Characteristics Summary File. In addition to the noisy measurements, constraints based on invariant calculations --- counts computed without noise --- are also included (with the exception of the state-level total populations, which can be sourced separately from data.census.gov).\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Noisy Measurement File was produced using the official “production settings,” the final set of algorithmic parameters and privacy-loss budget allocations that were used to produce the 2020 Census Redistricting Data (P.L. 94-171) Summary File and the 2020 Census Demographic and Housing Characteristics File.\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThe noisy measurements are produced in an early stage of the TDA. Afterward, these noisy measurements are post-processed to ensure internal and hierarchical consistency within the resulting tables. The Census Bureau has released these noisy measurements to enable data users to evaluate the impact of disclosure avoidance variability on 2020 Census data. The 2020 Census Demographic and Housing Characteristics (DHC) Noisy Measurement File has been cleared for public dissemination by the Census Bureau Disclosure Review Board (CBDRB-FY22-DSEP-004).\n<br/>\n<br/>\n",

The ufs-weather-model (UFS-WM) is the model source    of the UFS for NOAA’s operational numerical weather prediction applications. The UFS-WM Regression Test (RT) is the testing software to ensure that previously developed and tested capabilities in UFS-WM still work after code changes are integrated into the system. It is required that UFS-WM RTs are performed successfully on the required Tier-1 platforms whenever code changes are made to the UFS-WM.  The results of the UFS-WM RTs are summarized in log files and these files will be committed to the UFS-WM repository along with the code changes. Currently, the UFS-WM RTs have been developed to support several applications targeted for operational implementations including the global weather forecast, subseasonal to seasonal forecasts, hurricane forecast, regional rapid refresh forecast, and ocean analysis. <br/> <br/> At this time, there are 123 regression tests to support the UFS applications. The tests are evolving along with the development merged to the UFS-WM  code repository. The regression test framework has been developed in the UFS-WM to run these tests on tier-1 supported systems. Each of the regression tests require a set of input data files and configuration files. The configuration files include namelist and model configuration files residing within the UFS-WM code repository. The input data includes initial conditions, climatology data, and fixed data sets such as orographic data and grid specification data. In addition, the regression test framework maintains baseline data created from certain revisions of the UFS-WM code repository. When code changes are not expected to alter baseline results, regression tests will be performed against current baseline and as a result, the regression test log files are created – revealing a summary of no change within the results. If the code changes are expected to alter model results, impact to the regression tests will be specified in the pull request. The code changes and model results will be reviewed and confirmed. Once the model results are confirmed,  a new baseline will be generated. In some cases, new input data will need to be added or old data will need to be replaced, these data will be put in the input data location with proper timestamp, and regression tests will be performed with the updated data sets. <br/> <br/> The regression test framework serves as a test system to maintain the functionalities in the UFS-WM. The input data and the baselines need to be maintained and updated during the code integration to support the regression tests.",

The Deep Water Moorings facility (formerly known as the Australian Bluewater Observing System) provides the coordination of national efforts in the sustained observation of open ocean properties with particular emphasis on observations important to climate and carbon cycle studies, with selected moorings from its Deep Water Arrays sub-facility providing data to this collection.\nThis collection represents the hourly aggregated time-series product, which combines selected variables measured by all the instruments deployed at a site, binning the values into a fixed one-hour interval. Only good-quality measurements (according to the automated quality-control procedures applied by the National Mooring Network) are included. \nThe parameters are: temperature, salinity, dissolved oxygen, chlorophyll estimates, turbidity, down-welling photosynthetic photon flux (PAR), and current velocity, accompanied by depth and pressure when available. The observations were made using a range of temperature loggers, conductivity-temperature-depth (CTD) instruments, water-quality monitors (WQM), acoustic Doppler current profilers (ADCPs), and single-point current meters.",

    "Description": "This is a single-sensor multi-satellite  SSTfnd product for a single 24 hour period, derived using observations from AVHRR instruments on all available NOAA polar-orbiting satellites.  It is provided as a 0.02deg x 0.02deg cylindrical equidistant projected map over the region 70°E to 170°W, 20°N to 70°S.  Each grid cell contains the 24 hour average of all the highest available quality SSTs that overlap with that cell, weighted by the area of overlap.  The diagram at https://help.aodn.org.au/satellite-data-product-information/ indicates where this product fits within the GHRSST suite of NOAA/AVHRR products. The SSTfnd is derived by adding a constant 0.17 degC to the SSTskin observations after rejecting observations with low surface wind speeds (<6m/s by day and <2m/s at night) (see http://www.bom.gov.au/amoj/docs/2011/beggs.pdf). Matchups with buoy SSTfnd observations indicate typical 2014 biases of < 0.01 degC and standard deviations of 0.6 degC.

    "Description": "ERA5 is the fifth generation of ECMWF atmospheric reanalyses of the global climate, and the first reanalysis produced as an operational service. It utilizes the best available observation data from satellites and in-situ stations, which are assimilated and processed using ECMWF's Integrated Forecast System (IFS) Cycle 41r2.\nThe dataset provides all essential atmospheric meteorological parameters like, but not limited to, air temperature, pressure and wind at different altitudes, along with surface parameters like rainfall, soil moisture content and sea parameters like sea-surface temperature and wave height.\nERA5 provides data at a considerably higher spatial and temporal resolution than its legacy counterpart ERA-Interim. ERA5 consists of high resolution version with 31 km horizontal resolution, and a reduced resolution ensemble version with 10 members. It is currently available since 2008, but will be continuously extended backwards, first until 1979 and then to 1950.\nLearn more about ERA5 in Jon Olauson's paper [ERA5: The new champion of wind power modelling?](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/320084119_ERA5_The_new_champion_of_wind_power_modelling).\n",

    "Description": "The WSA-Enlil heliospheric model provides critical information regarding the propagation of solar Coronal Mass Ejections (CMEs) and transient structures within the heliosphere. Two distinct models comprise the WSA-Enlil modeling system; 1) the Wang-Sheeley-Arge (WSA) semi-empirical solar coronal model, and 2) the Enlil magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) heliospheric model. MHD modeling of the full domain (solar photosphere to Earth) is extremely computationally demanding due to the large parameter space and resulting characteristic speeds within the system. To reduce the computational burden and improve the timeliness (and hence the utility in forecasting space weather disturbances) of model results, the domain of the MHD model (Enlil) is limited from 21.5 Solar Radii (R_s) to just beyond the orbit of Earth, while the inner portion, spanning from the solar photosphere to 21.5R_s, is characterized by the WSA model. This coupled modeling system is driven by solar synoptic maps composed of numerous magnetogram observations from the National Solar Observatory’s (NSO) Global Oscillation Network Group (GONG). Such maps provide a full surface description of solar photospheric magnetic flux density, while not accounting for the evolution of surface features for regions outside the view of the observatories. <br/> <br/> In its current configuration (NOAA WSA-Enlil V3.0), the modeling system consists of WSA V5.4 and Enlil V2.9e. The system relies upon the zero point corrected GONG synoptic maps (mrzqs) to define the inner photospheric boundary. <br/> <br/> The operational data files provided in this bucket include NetCDF files containing 3-dimensional gridded neutral density from 100 to 1000 km, Total Electron Content (TEC), and Maximum Usable Frequency (MUF). <br/> <br/> The full 3D datasets from the operational model are provided here as compressed tar files with naming convention wsa_enlil.mrid########.full3d.tgz. These files consist of the full set of 3D datacubes (tim.*.nc), all time series results stored at predefined observation points (evo.*.nc), and supplemented by the operational CME fits (conefiles) and the operationally employed photospheric boundary synoptic maps (GONG mrzqs files).",

Cropland is defined as: \"a piece of land of minimum 0.01 ha (a single 10m x 10m pixel) that is sowed/planted and harvest-able at least once within the 12 months after the sowing/planting date.\" This definition will exclude non-planted grazing lands and perennial crops which can be difficult for satellite imagery to differentiate from natural vegetation. \nThis provisional cropland extent map has a resolution of 10m, and was built using Copernicus Sentinel-2 satellite images from 2019. The cropland extent map was produced using extensive training data from regions across Africa, coupled with a Random Forest machine learning model. The continental service contains maps built separately for eight Agro-Ecological Zones (AEZs). For a detailed exploration of the methods used to produce the cropland extent map, read the Jupyter Notebooks in DE Africa’s crop-mask GitHub repository.\n",

At most, Catastrophic Damage-causing winds was possible especially in the areas of Rakhine State and Chin State, and Severe Damage-causing winds is possible in the areas of Rakhine, Chin, Magway, and Sagaing ([source] TAOS Model, DisasterAWARE). Bangladesh were preparing to evacuate over 500,000 people as the World Meteorological Organisation (WMO) has warned of big humanitarian impacts once the storm makes landfall. Due to its intensity, Cyclone Mocha is expected to inundate several low-lying areas of the delta nation of Bangladesh which could consequently cause landslides.576 cyclone shelters are ready to provide refuge to those evacuated however damage to infrastructure and agriculture would be devastating.Myanmar ?

CZ CELLxGENE Discover hosts the largest aggregation of standardized single-cell data from the major human and mouse tissues, with modalities that include gene expression, chromatin accessibility, DNA methylation, and spatial transcriptomics.\nThis year, CZ CELLxGENE Discover has made available all of its human and mouse RNA single-cell data through Census (https://chanzuckerberg.github.io/cellxgene-census/) – a free-to-use service with an API and data that allows for querying its single-cell data corpus directly from Python or R. \nThe API uses a new technology, TileDB-SOMA, that allows for efficient and low-latency querying. The data are fully standardized and hosted publicly for free access, and they are composed by a count matrix of tens of millions of cells (observations) by >60 k genes (features) accompanied by standard cell metadata variables (e.g. cell type, tissue, sequencing technology, donor id, etc)  and gene metadata that includes GENCODE-based IDs and gene names. While these data are built from hundreds of datasets, the APIs enable convenient cell- and gene-based filtering to obtain any slice of interest in a matter of seconds. All data can be quickly transformed to NumPy, Pandas, Anndata, Seurat, or R base objects. We created data loaders for the data to be directly used by PyTorch for modeling at scale.\nIn addition, all the source dataset files in H5AD format are also available for retrieval. \n",

It provides insight into how areas of dry vegetation and/or bare soil and green vegetation are changing over time. The product is derived from Landsat satellite data, using an algorithm developed by the [Joint Remote Sensing Research Program](https://www.jrsrp.org.au/). \nDigital Earth Africa's FC service has two components. Fractional Cover is estimated from each Landsat scene, providing measurements from individual days. Fractional Cover Annual Summary (Percentiles) provides 10th, 50th, and 90th percentiles estimated independently for the green vegetation, non-green vegetation, and bare soil fractions observed in each calendar year (1st of January - 31st December).\nWhile the scene based Fractional Cover can be used to study dynamic processes, the annual summaries make it easier to analyse year to year changes. The percentiles provide robust estimates of the low, median and high proportion values observed for each cover type in a year, which can be used to characterise the land cover.\n",

    "Name": "2010 Census Production Settings Demographic and Housing Characteristics (DHC) Demonstration Noisy Measurement File",
    "Description": "The 2010 Census Production Settings Demographic and Housing Characteristics (DHC) Demonstration Noisy Measurement File (2023-06-30) is an intermediate output of the 2020 Census Disclosure Avoidance System (DAS) TopDown Algorithm (TDA) (as described in Abowd, J. et al [2022] https://doi.org/10.1162/99608f92.529e3cb9 , and implemented in https://github.com/uscensusbureau/DAS_2020_Redistricting_Production_Code). The NMF was produced using the official “production settings,” the final set of algorithmic parameters and privacy-loss budget allocations, that were used to produce the 2020 Census Redistricting Data (P.L. 94-171) Summary File and the 2020 Census Demographic and Housing Characteristics File.  The NMF consists of the full set of privacy-protected statistical queries (counts of individuals or housing units with particular combinations of characteristics) of confidential 2010 Census data relating to the 2010 Demonstration Data Products Suite – Redistricting (P.L. 94-171) and Demographic and Housing Characteristics File – Production Settings (2023-04-03). These statistical queries, called “noisy measurements” were produced under the zero-Concentrated Differential Privacy framework (Bun, M. and Steinke, T [2016] https://arxiv.org/abs/1605.02065; see also Dwork C. and Roth, A. [2014] https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~aaroth/Papers/privacybook.pdf) implemented via the discrete Gaussian mechanism (Cannone C., et al., [2023] https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.00010), which added positive or negative integer-valued noise to each of the resulting counts. The noisy measurements are an intermediate stage of the TDA prior to the post-processing the TDA then performs to ensure internal and hierarchical consistency within the resulting tables. The Census Bureau has released these 2010 Census demonstration data to enable data users to evaluate the expected impact of disclosure avoidance variability on 2020 Census data. The 2010 Census Production Settings Demographic and Housing Characteristics (DHC) Demonstration Noisy Measurement File (2023-04-03) has been cleared for public dissemination by the Census Bureau Disclosure Review Board (CBDRB-FY22-DSEP-004). <br/> <br/> The 2010 Census Production Settings Demographic and Housing Characteristics Demonstration Noisy Measurement File includes zero-Concentrated Differentially Private (zCDP) (Bun, M. and Steinke, T [2016]) noisy measurements, implemented via the discrete Gaussian mechanism. These are estimated counts of individuals and housing units included in the 2010 Census Edited File (CEF), which includes confidential data initially collected in the 2010 Census of Population and Housing. The noisy measurements included in this file were subsequently post-processed by the TopDown Algorithm (TDA) to produce the 2010 Census Production Settings Privacy-Protected Microdata File - Redistricting (P.L. 94-171) and Demographic and Housing Characteristics File (2023-04-03) (https://www2.census.gov/programs-surveys/decennial/2020/program-management/data-product-planning/2010-demonstration-data-products/04-Demonstration_Data_Products_Suite/2023-04-03/). As these 2010 Census demonstration data are intended to support study of the design and expected impacts of the 2020 Disclosure Avoidance System, the 2010 CEF records were pre-processed before application of the zCDP framework. This pre-processing converted the 2010 CEF records into the input-file format, response codes, and tabulation categories used for the 2020 Census, which differ in substantive ways from the format, response codes, and tabulation categories originally used for the 2010 Census. <br/> <br/> The NMF provides estimates of counts of persons in the CEF by various characteristics and combinations of characteristics including their reported race and ethnicity, whether they were of voting age, whether they resided in a housing unit or one of 7 group quarters types, and their census block of residence after the addition of discrete Gaussian noise (with the scale parameter determined by the privacy-loss budget allocation for that particular query under zCDP). Noisy measurements of the counts of occupied and vacant housing units by census block are also included. Lastly, data on constraints—information into which no noise was infused by the Disclosure Avoidance System (DAS) and used by the TDA to post-process the noisy measurements into the 2010 Census Production Settings Privacy-Protected Microdata File - Redistricting (P.L. 94-171) and Demographic and Housing Characteristics File (2023-04-03) —are provided.",

    "Description": "These data originate from NOAA/NCEP.\n\nThe NOAA Climate Prediction Center/NCEP/NWS is making the data available originally in binary format, in a weekly rotating archive. The NASA GES DISC is acquiring the binary files as they become available, converts them into CF (Climate and Forecast) -convention compliant netCDF-4 format, and stores the product in a permanent archive. The original record started from February, 2000, but in June, 2025 it was extended back to January, 1998.\n\nThe leading edge of data availability is delayed by about 24 hours from real-time to abide by international data exchange agreements between NOAA and EUMETSAT (the METEOSAT data providers).\n\nThe data contain globally-merged (60°S-60°N) 4-km pixel-resolution IR brightness temperature data (equivalent blackbody temps), merged from the European, Japanese, and U.S. geostationary satellites over the period of record (GOES-8/9/10/11/12/13/14/15/16/17/18/19, METEOSAT-5/7/8/9/10/11, and GMS-5/MTSat-1R/2/Himawari-8/9).\n\nThe global geo-IR are dynamically calibrated to GOES East, using a 35 day trailing inter-calibration using time/space-matched IR Tb’s at the mid-point between sub-satellite positions.  In the event of duplicate data in a grid box, the value with the smaller zenith angle is taken. The data have been corrected for \"zenith angle dependence\", in which IR temperatures for locations far from satellite nadir are erroneously cold due to a combination of geometric effects and radiometric path extinction effects (Joyce et al. 2001). Finally, the data are re-navigated for parallax, which shifts the geo-location of the GEO-IR footprints to approximately account for the cloud tops that the IR “sees” being displaced away from their actual geographic location when viewed along a slanted path. These corrections allow for the merging of the IR data from the various GEO-satellites with greatly reduced discontinuities at GEO-satellite data boundaries. In the event of duplicate data in a grid box, the value with the smaller zenith angle is taken.\n\nThe NASA GES DISC is curating these data in a self-documenting, CF-compliant, netCDF-4 format, which allows a broad range of applications to access the data directly, without the need to cope with the original binary data format. In addition to the direct download of netCDF-4 data, the GES DISC provides data download in binary, ASCII, and netCDF-3 formats using the OPeNDAP interface.\n\nSimilarities with the original\n-----------------------------\nAs in the original binaries, every netCDF-4 file covers one hour, and contains two half-hourly grids, at 4-km grid cell resolution. \n\nDifferences from the original\n-----------------------------\n1. The data in the netCDF-4 files are already converted to real (float) values of Brightness Temperatures in Kelvin. There is no need to further scale these data. The netCDF-4 format is machine-independent and users need not worry about the endian-ness of their machines. \n\n2. To meet the requirements of collection spatial metadata, the grid is re-ordered from the original and now goes from -180 (West) to 180 (East). It is also starting from -60 (South).\n\nThe data and time units are reflected in the corresponding \"units\" attributes, and grid dimensions are described by longitude (\"lon\"), latitude (\"lat\") and \"time\" vectors. Thus, any CF-compliant tool should automatically understand the setup in the data files and the starting time for each half-hourly grid. Even without such tools, simple \"ncdump\" or \"h5dump\" command line tools will easily disclose the netCDF-4 files configuration.\n\nAcknowledgements\n------------------\nThe creation of the original data at NOAA/NCEP is supported by funding from the NOAA Office of Global Programs for the Global Precipitation Climatology Project (GPCP) and by NASA via the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM). \n\nThe permanent archive at GES DISC is supported by NASA's HQ Earth Science Data Systems (ESDS) Program. \n\n\n\nRead our doc on how to get AWS Credentials to retrieve this data: https://data.gesdisc.earthdata.nasa.gov/s3credentialsREADME",

It covers North America and is run with a horizontal resolution of 13 km and 50 vertical layers. The RAP was developed to serve users needing frequently updated short-range weather forecasts, including those in the US aviation community and US severe weather forecasting community. The model is run for every hour of the day; it is integrated to 51 hours for the 03/09/15/21 UTC cycles and to 21 hours for every other cycle. The RAP uses the ARW core of the WRF model and the Gridpoint Statistical Interpolation (GSI) analysis - the analysis is aided with the assimilation of cloud and hydrometeor data to provide more skill in short-range cloud and precipitation forecasts.",

The algorithm used for the MOD16 data product collection is based on the logic of the Penman-Monteith equation, which includes inputs of daily meteorological reanalysis data along with Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) remotely sensed data products such as vegetation property dynamics, albedo, and land cover. \n\nProvided in the MOD16A2 product are layers for composited Evapotranspiration (ET), Latent Heat Flux (LE), Potential ET (PET) and Potential LE (PLE) along with a quality control layer. Two low resolution browse images, ET and LE, are also available for each MOD16A2 granule.\n\nThe pixel values for the two Evapotranspiration layers (ET and PET) are the sum of all eight days within the composite period and the pixel values for the two Latent Heat layers (LE and PLE) are the average of all eight days within the composite period. Note that the last acquisition period of each year is a 5 or 6-day composite period, depending on the year.\n\nKnown Issues\n* Operational and uncertainty issues are provided under Section 3 in the User Guide.\n* For complete information about known issues please refer to the [MODIS/VIIRS Land Quality Assessment website](https://landweb.modaps.eosdis.nasa.gov/knownissue?sensor=MODIS&sat=Terra&as=61).\n\nImprovements/Changes from Previous Versions\n* The Version 6.1 Level-1B (L1B) products have been improved by undergoing various calibration changes that include: changes to the response-versus-scan angle (RVS) approach that affects reflectance bands for Aqua and Terra MODIS, corrections to adjust for the optical crosstalk in Terra MODIS infrared (IR) bands, and corrections to the Terra MODIS forward look-up table (LUT) update for the period 2012 - 2017.\n* A polarization correction has been applied to the L1B Reflective Solar Bands (RSB).\n* The product uses Climatology LAI/FPAR as back up to the operational LAI/FPAR.\nRead our doc on how to get AWS Credentials to retrieve this data: https://data.lpdaac.earthdatacloud.nasa.gov/s3credentialsREADME",

    "Name": "Ocean Radar - Coffs Harbour site - Sea water velocity - Delayed mode",
    "Description": "The Coffs Harbour (COF) HF ocean radar site is located near the point at which the East Australian Current (EAC) begins to separate from the coast.  Here the EAC is at its narrowest and swiftest: to the north it is forming from the westwards subtropical jet, and to the south it forms eddies and eventually the warm water moves eastwards across the Tasman Sea, forming a front with the cold water of the Southern Ocean.  \n\nThe connection between coastal and continental shelf waters is fundamental to the understanding of the anthropogenic impact on the coastal ocean and the role of the ocean in mitigating urban marine water quality. The oceans off Eastern Australia and in particular in the region of New South Wales have a complex circulation structure, and are strongly connected with other regional seas and currents. \n\nThe East Australia Current (EAC) flows from tropical regions southward along the NSW continental slope, bringing tropical biota southward. These current structures provide strong physical and biological connectivity, allowing substantial transport and dispersion of biota between regions, and influencing the transport and upwelling of nutrients, which are fundamental to biological productivity.  \n\nThe COF HF ocean radar is a WERA phased array system with 16-element receive arrays located at Red Rock (-23.942 S, 151.371 E) to the north of Coffs Harbour and North Nambucca (-24.111 S, 152.713 E) to the south.  The area of focus is off Coffs Harbour where IMOS and the NSW government have mooring sites.  These radars operate at a frequency of 13.920 MHz, with a bandwidth of 100 KHz and a maximum range of 100 Km.  Within the HF radar coverage area surface currents are measured.  Data are also collected from which wind directions and significant wave height can be calculated.",

It includes datasets collected with both two-photon imaging and Neuropixels probes, two complementary techniques for measuring the activity of neurons in vivo. The two-photon imaging dataset features visually evoked calcium responses from GCaMP6-expressing neurons in a range of cortical layers, visual areas, and Cre lines. The Neuropixels dataset features spiking activity from distributed cortical and subcortical brain regions, collected under analogous conditions to the two-photon imaging experiments. We hope that experimentalists and modelers will use these comprehensive, open datasets as a testbed for theories of visual information processing.\n",

    "Description": "The \"[Unified Forecast System](https://ufs.epic.noaa.gov/)\" (UFS) is a community-based, coupled, comprehensive Earth Modeling System. The Hierarchical Testing Framework (HTF) serves as a comprehensive toolkit designed to enhance the testing capabilities within UFS \"[repositories](https://github.com/ufs-community)\". It aims to standardize and simplify the testing process across various \"[UFS Weather Model](https://github.com/ufs-community/ufs-weather-model)\" (WM) components and associated modules, aligning with the Hierarchical System Development (HSD) approach and NOAA baseline operational metrics.\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThe HTF provides a structured methodology for test case design and execution, which enhances code management practices, fosters user accessibility, and promotes adherence to established testing protocols. It enables developers to conduct testing efficiently and consistently, ensuring code integrity and reliability through the use of established technologies such as CMake and CTest. When integrated with containerization techniques, the HTF facilitates portability of test cases and promotes reproducibility across different computing environments. This approach reduces the computational overhead and enhances collaboration within the UFS community by providing a unified testing framework. \n<br/>\n<br/>\nAcknowledgment - The Unified Forecast System (UFS) atmosphere-ocean coupled model experimental version # data used in this study are made available through the UFS Research to Operations (UFS-R2O) project sponsored by the National Weather Service (NWS) Office of Science and Technology Integration (OSTI) Modeling Program Division and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Oceanic and Atmospheric Research (OAR) Weather Program Office (WPO).\n",

Older versions will no longer be available and have been superseded by Version 2.\n\nThis land sea mask originated from the NOAA group at SSEC in the 1980s. It was originally produced at 1/6 deg resolution, and then regridded for the purposes of GPCP, TMPA, and IMERG precipitation products. NASA code 610.2, Terrestrial Information Systems Laboratory, restructured this land sea mask to match the IMERG grid, and converted the file to CF-compliant netCDF4. Version 2 was created in May, 2019 to resolve detected inaccuracies in coastal regions.\n\nUsers should be aware that this is a static mask, i.e. there is no seasonal or annual variability, and it is due for update. It is not recommended to be used outside of the aforementioned precipitation data.\nRead our doc on how to get AWS Credentials to retrieve this data: https://data.gesdisc.earthdata.nasa.gov/s3credentialsREADME",

We discovered cell-specific changes occurring across multiple cell types and organs, as well as age related changes in the cellular composition of different organs. Using single-cell transcriptomic data we were able to assess cell type specific manifestations of different hallmarks of aging, such as senescence, changes in the activity of metabolic pathways, depletion of stem-cell populations, genomic instability and the role of inflammation as well as other changes in the organism’s immune system. Tabula Muris Senis provides a wealth of new molecular information about how the most significant hallmarks of aging are reflected in a broad range of tissues and cell types.See: https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/661728v1\n",

We present the seasonal variation in weather, lighting, construction and traffic conditions experienced in dynamic urban environments. This dataset can help design robust algorithms for autonomous vehicles and multi-agent systems. Each log in the dataset is time-stamped and contains raw data from all the sensors, calibration values, pose trajectory, ground truth pose, and 3D maps. All data is available in Rosbag format that can be visualized, modified and applied using the open-source Robot Operating System (ROS).",

    "Description": "[Folding@home](http://foldingathome.org) is a massively distributed computing project that uses biomolecular simulations to investigate the [molecular origins of disease](https://foldingathome.org/diseases/) and accelerate the discovery of new therapies. Run by the [Folding@home Consortium](https://foldingathome.org/about/the-foldinghome-consortium/), a worldwide network of research laboratories focusing on a variety of different diseases, Folding@home seeks to address problems in human health on a scale that is infeasible by another other means, sharing the results of these large-scale studies with the research community through [peer-reviewed publications](https://foldingathome.org/papers-results/) and publicly shared datasets. During the [COVID-19 epidemic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus_disease_2019), Folding@home focused its resources on understanding the vulnerabilities in [SARS-CoV-2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Severe_acute_respiratory_syndrome_coronavirus_2), the virus that causes COVID-19 disease, and working closely with a number of experimental collaborators to accelerate progress toward effective therapies for treating COVID-19 and ending the pandemic. In the process, it created the world's first [exascale distributed computing resource](https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.06.27.175430), enabling it to generate valuable scientific datasets of unprecedented size. More information about Folding@home's COVID-19 research activities at the [Folding@home COVID-19 page](https://foldingathome.org/diseases/infectious-diseases/covid-19/). In addition to working directly with experimental collaborators and rapidly sharing new research findings through preprint servers, Folding@home has joined other researchers in committing to [rapidly share all COVID-19 research data](https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.jcim.0c00319), and has joined forces with [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/) and the [Molecular Sciences Software Institute (MolSSI)](http://molssi.org) to share datasets of unprecedented side through the [AWS Open Data Registry](https://registry.opendata.aws/), indexing these massive datasets via the [MolSSI COVID-19 Molecular Structure and Therapeutics Hub](https://covid.molssi.org/). The complete index of all Folding@home datasets can be found [here](https://covid.molssi.org//org-contributions/#folding--home). This repository contains several major datasets from this effort and comprises the single largest collection of molecular simulation data ever released.\n",

The goal is to foster collaboration across organizations and develop the ability for direct comparison of Earth System reanalysis results. Providing a singular dataset for observation input use will allow reanalyses to be compared on their unique development qualities by removing the variation from using different observations. We anticipate that the open dataset will be of value to the wider Earth System community, including future applications outside of the original goal of reanalysis production.\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThe archive is hosted in an Amazon Web Services (AWS) S3 bucket with atmosphere, ice, land and ocean observations in formats including bufr, ioda, and netcdf. The general structure file structure is noaa-reanalyses-pds/observations/reanalysis/{sensor}/{source(s)}/YYYY/MM/{file format}/{data files}. Some data is reprocessed as appropriate. The dataset also includes specification of observational errors and a black/white list for historic observations which can be access via the [NNJA site](https://psl.noaa.gov/data/nnja_obs/).\n",

    "Description": "Here, we collected and pre-processed a massive, high-quality 7T fMRI dataset that can be used to advance our understanding of how the brain works. A unique feature of this dataset is the massive amount of data available per individual subject. The data were acquired using ultra-high-field fMRI (7T, whole-brain, 1.8-mm resolution, 1.6-s TR). We measured fMRI responses while each of 8 participants viewed 9,000–10,000 distinct, color natural scenes (22,500–30,000 trials) in 30–40 weekly scan sessions over the course of a year. Additional measures were collected including resting-state data, retinotopy, category localizers, anatomical data (T1, T2, diffusion, venogram, angiogram), physiological data (pulse, respiration), eye-tracking data, and additional behavioral assessments outside the scanner. Because of its unprecedented scale and richness, NSD can be used to explore diverse neuroscientific questions with high power at the level of individual subjects. In particular, the number of images sampled in this dataset is sufficiently large that the dataset may be of high interest for computer vision, machine learning, and other data-driven applications.",

    "Description": "DE Africa’s Sentinel-1 backscatter product is developed to be compliant with the CEOS Analysis Ready Data for Land (CARD4L) specifications.\nThe Sentinel-1 mission, composed of a constellation of two C-band Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) satellites, are operated by European Space Agency (ESA) as part of the Copernicus Programme. The mission currently collects data every 12 days over Africa at a spatial resolution of approximately 20 m.\nRadar backscatter measures the amount of microwave radiation reflected back to the sensor from the ground surface. This measurement is sensitive to surface roughness, moisture content and viewing geometry. DE Africa provides Sentinel-1 backscatter as Radiometrically Terrain Corrected (RTC) gamma-0 (γ0) where variation due to changing observation geometries has been mitigated.\nThe dual polarisation backcastter time series can be used in applications for forests, agriculture, wetlands and land cover classification. SAR’s ability to ‘see through’ clouds makes it critical for mapping and monitoring land cover changes in the wet tropics.\n",

Texas A&M University (TAMU) and National Center for Atmospheric Research together with international partners collaboratively carried out a large set of high-resolution climate simulations, including a 500-year long preindustrial control simulation (PI-CTRL) described here. The CESM uses dynamic equations with a climatological (observations, long-term averaged) initial state of the earth system and the preindustrial greenhouse gas forcing (kept constant at the 1850 conditions) for making this PI-CTRL. Compared to standard low-resolution (1o) CMIP-class simulations, this high-resolution simulation dataset enables researchers to explore the contribution from processes at a wide range of spatial scales, from mesoscales to global scales, in shaping various observed climate phenomena with better accuracy.",

The wave ensemble was run with one cycle per day (at 03Z), spatial resolution of 0.25°X0.25° and temporal resolution of 3 hours. There are five ensemble members (control plus four perturbed members) and, once a week (Wednesdays), the ensemble is expanded to eleven members. The forecast range is 16 days and, once a week (Wednesdays), it extends to 35 days. More information about the wave modeling, wave grids and calibration can be found in the WAVEWATCH III regtest ww3_ufs1.3 (https://github.com/NOAA-EMC/WW3/tree/develop/regtests/ww3_ufs1.3).\n<br/><br/>\nThe 20 years of reforecast results were analyzed and quality-controlled. Three output types are available\n<br/><br/>\n1) Global wave fields, in grib2 format, with several variables including significant wave height, period, direction, and partitions;\n<br/>\n2) Point output tables, in netcdf format, containing time-series of significant wave height, period and direction, for 658 points (latitude/longitude informed) at the positions of wave buoys;  and,\n<br/>\n3) For the same positions, spectral outputs are available, in netcdf format, containing the full spectra (2D directional spectrum).\n<br/>\nEach file refers to one forecast cycle with date (year, month, day) written in the file name.\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThis effort has been funded by a NOAA OAR/NWS Service Level Agreement (SLA) whereby NOAA/OAR supports R&D and transition needed for mission delivery of climate\nservices within NWS. The SLA project is led by NWS/NCEP/Ocean Prediction Center in collaboration with NWS/NCEP/Environmental Modeling Center and NWS/NCEP/Climate \nPrediction Center. This is a project also in cooperation with NOAA’s Atlantic Oceanographic and Meteorological Laboratory (AOML) and the University of Miami’s \nCooperative Institute for Marine and Atmospheric Studies (CIMAS).\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThe following github repository has examples and scripts to support users to download, visualize, and process the WAVEWATCH III output files\n<br/>\n<br/>\nhttps://github.com/ricampos/gefswaves_reforecast\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThe reforecast simulations were generated on the supercomputer Orion, which is funded via a grant from NOAA to support research activities in environmental  \nmodeling, including weather modeling and simulation\n<br/>\n<br/>\nhttps://www.noaa.gov/organization/information-technology/orion\n",

    "Name": "Satellite - Ocean Colour - MODIS - 1 day - Net Primary Productivity (OC3 model and Eppley-VGPM algorithm)",
    "Description": "The Aqua satellite platform carries a MODIS sensor that observes sunlight reflected from within the ocean surface layer at multiple wavelengths. These multi-spectral measurements are used to infer the concentration of chlorophyll-a (Chl-a), most typically due to phytoplankton, present in the water. Modelling is then used to compute an estimate of the Net Primary Productivity (NPP).\n\nThe model used is based on the standard vertically generalised production model (VGPM).  The VGPM is a \"chlorophyll-based\" model that estimates net primary production from chlorophyll using a temperature-dependent description of chlorophyll-specific        photosynthetic efficiency. For the VGPM, net primary production is a function of chlorophyll, available light, and the photosynthetic efficiency. The only difference between the Standard VGPM and the Eppley-VGPM is the temperature-dependent description of photosynthetic efficiencies, with the Eppley approach using an exponential function to account for variation in photosynthetic efficiencies due to photoacclimation. The similarity between these models (VGPM vs E_VGPM) is described more extensively in a paper by Elena-Carr et al (2006.). VGPM is a Depth Integrated Model(DIM) described by Behrenfeld and Falkowski (1997), with modification due to Eppley (1972) as implemented by Antoine and Morel (1996).\n\nThere are multiple retrieval algorithms for estimating Chl-a. These data (eppley_npp_chl_oc3) use the OC3 method implemented by the NASA Ocean Biology Processing Group in the SeaDAS processing software l2gen. The OC3 algorithm is described at https://oceancolor.gsfc.nasa.gov/atbd/chlor_a/ (and links therein). The  Eppley_NPP_chl_oc3 product (based on the IMOS chl_oc3 product) is experimental and was created for comparison purposes with Eppley_NPP_chl_gsm, which is the recommended NPP product. It should only be used with full understanding of the algorithms. If you do not know which product to use, then go with Eppley_NPP_chl_gsm.",

    "Description": "CCKP provides open access to a comprehensive suite of climate and climate change resources derived from the latest generation of climate data archives. Products are based on a consistent and transparent approach with a systematic way of pre-processing the raw observed and model-based projection data to enable inter-comparable use across a broad range of applications. Climate products consist of basic climate variables as well as a large collection (70+) of more specialized, application-orientated variables and indices across different scenarios. Precomputed data can be extracted per specified variables, select timeframes, climate projection scenarios, across ensembles or individual models, etc. CCKP adheres to data distributions standards defined under the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP) and its contributions to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Assessment Reports and latest scientific methodologies identified by the World Meteorological Organization and climate science community. Climate products are available for the following collections. Downscaled CMIP6 global 0.25-degree – 1950-2100; ERA5 global 0.25-degree – 1950-2022; CRU global 0.50-degree – 1901-2022; Population global 0.25-degree – 1995-2100 (GPW v4).",

    "Description": "The Japan Aerospace EXploration Agency (JAXA) SELenological and ENgineering Explorer (SELENE) mission’s Kaguya spacecraft was launched on September 14, 2007 and science operations around the Moon started October 20, 2007. The primary mission in a circular polar orbit 100-km above the surface lasted from October 20, 2007 until October 31, 2008. An extended mission was then conducted in lower orbits (averaging 50km above the surface) from November 1, 2008 until the SELENE mission ended with Kaguya impacting the Moon on June 10, 2009. These data are digital terrain models derived using the NASA Ames Stereo Pipeline (ASP) and the Kaguya stereoscopic data. Digital terrain models (DTMs) in this data set were bundle adjusted and aligned to Lunar Orbiter Laser Altimeter (LOLA) shot data. The sensor model intrinsics used for these data have been re-estimated to reduce inter-DTM horizontal and vertical errors. Data are controlled to LOLA using the ASP pc_align program. Data co-register at orthoimage resolution (11-37 meters per pixel). At image resolution horizontal offsets are measurable. Horizontal precision is measures to be better than 30 meters per pixel on average. Vertical errors are mean centered to zero. An assessment of overlapping DTMs showed vertical precision on the order of 4 meters. Spacecraft jitter and unmodelled lense distortion at the observation edges is believed to be the major contributor to the vertical errors. To create these analysis ready data, we have taken the ASP genreated data, map projected the data to a stereopair centered orthographic projection and converted to a Cloud Optimized GeoTiff (COG) for online streaming. These data use a priori spacecraft ephemerides (for the nominal mission) and improved, but not controlled spacecraft ephemerides for the extended mission. These data co-register with other LOLA controlled data to the aforementioned horizontal and vertical accuracies.\n",

The data within this repository contains received telemetry frames, including radiosonde type, gps position, and for some radiosondes atmospheric sensor data (temperature, humidity, pressure). As the downlinked telemetry does not always contain calibration information, any atmospheric sensor data should be considered to be uncalibrated.

GOES-East is positioned at 75 deg W longitude over the equator. GOES-West is located at 137.2 deg W longitude over the equator. Both satellites cover an area from the eastern Atlantic Ocean to the central Pacific Ocean region. The Meteosat-10 satellite is located at 0 deg E longitude to cover Europe and Africa regions. The Meteosat-9 satellite is located at 45.5 deg E longitude to cover the Indian Ocean region. The Himawari-9 satellite is located at 140.7 deg E longitude to cover the Asia-Oceania region. The visible imagery indicates cloud cover and ice and snow cover. The shortwave, or mid-infrared, indicates cloud cover and fog at night. The longwave, or thermal infrared, depicts cloud cover and land/sea temperature patterns. The water vapor imagery indicates the amount of water vapor contained in the mid to upper levels of the troposphere, with the darker grays indicating drier air and the brighter grays/whites indicating more saturated air. GMGSI composite images have an approximate 8 km (5 mile) horizontal resolution and are updated every hour.\n",

    "Description": "\nNOTICE - The Coast Survey Development Laboratory (CSDL) in NOAA/National Ocean Service (NOS)/Office of Coast Survey has upgraded the Surge and Tide Operational Forecast System (STOFS, formerly ESTOFS) to Version 2.1. A Service Change Notice (SCN) has been issued and can be found \"[HERE](https://www.weather.gov/media/notification/pdf_2023_24/scn23-124_stofs_upgrade_v2.1.4_aaf.pdf)\"<br /><br />\n\nNOAA's Global Surge and Tide Operational Forecast System 2-D (STOFS-2D-Global) provides users with nowcasts (analyses of near present conditions) and forecast guidance of water level conditions for the entire globe. STOFS-2D-Global has been developed to serve the marine navigation, weather forecasting, and disaster mitigation user communities. STOFS-2D-Global was developed in a collaborative effort between the NOAA/National Ocean Service (NOS)/Office of Coast Survey, the NOAA/National Weather Service (NWS)/National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) Central Operations (NCO), the University of Notre Dame, the University of North Carolina, and The Water Institute of the Gulf. The model generates forecasts out to 180 hours four times per day; forecast output includes water levels caused by the combined effects of storm surge and tides, by astronomical tides alone, and by sub-tidal water levels (isolated storm surge).  <br /><br />\n\nThe hydrodynamic model employed by STOFS-2D-Global is the ADvanced CIRCulation (ADCIRC) finite element model. The model is forced by GFS winds, mean sea level pressure, and sea ice. The unstructured grid used by STOFS-2D-Global consists of 12,785,004 nodes and 24,875,336 triangular elements. Coastal resolution is at least 1.5 km globally, and up to 80 m for the U.S. West Coast and Alaska, up to 90-120 m for the Pacific Islands including Hawaii, Guam, American Samoa, Marianas, Wake Island, Marshall Islands, and Palau, and up to 120 m for the U.S. East Coast and Puerto Rico. The flood plain extends overland to approximately 10 m elevation above MSL for the U.S. East Coast, and up to 20 m elevation above MSL for the Pacific Islands. STOFS-2D-Global water level forecast guidance is referenced to global MSL (GMSL) for gridded output and local MSL (LMSL) for station output (SHEF files are referenced to MLLW). <br /><br />\n\nSTOFS-2D-Global water level forecast guidance output available here include NetCDF, GRIB2, and SHEF files. Please see README documentation for more details.\n",

    "Name": "Satellite - Sea surface temperature - Level 3 - Single sensor - 1 month - Day time",
    "Description": "This is a single-sensor multi-satellite SSTskin product for 1 month of consecutive day-time periods, derived using observations from AVHRR instruments on all available NOAA polar-orbiting satellites.  It is provided as a 0.02deg x 0.02deg cylindrical equidistant projected map over the region 70°E to 170°W, 20°N to 70°S.  Each grid cell contains the 1 month average of all the highest available quality SSTs that overlap with that cell, weighted by the area of overlap. The diagram at https://help.aodn.org.au/satellite-data-product-information/ indicates where this product fits within the GHRSST suite of NOAA/AVHRR products.  Matchups with buoy SST observations for the central date (adjusted to skin depths) indicate typical 2014 biases of < 0.3 degC and standard deviations of 0.7 degC.  Refer to the IMOS SST products web page at http://imos.org.au/sstproducts.html and Beggs et al. (2013) at http://imos.org.au/sstdata_references.html for further information.",

Yet breast cancer mortality in high-income countries has dropped by 40% since the 1980s when health authorities implemented regular mammography screening in age groups considered at risk. Early detection and treatment are critical to reducing cancer fatalities, and your machine learning skills could help streamline the process radiologists use to evaluate screening mammograms. Currently, early detection of breast cancer requires the expertise of highly-trained human observers, making screening mammography programs expensive to conduct. RSNA collected screening mammograms and supporting information from two sites, totaling just under 20,000 imaging studies.",

These datasets are thoroughly vetted time series measurements with the longevity, consistency, and continuity to assess and measure climate variability and change. NOAA CDRs are vetted using standards established by the National Research Council (NRC).<br/><br/>\nClimate Data Records are created by merging data from surface, atmosphere, and space-based systems across decades. NOAA’s Climate Data Records provides authoritative and traceable long-term climate records. NOAA developed CDRs by applying modern data analysis methods to historical global satellite data. This process can clarify the underlying climate trends within the data and allows researchers and other users to identify economic and scientific value in these records. NCEI maintains and extends CDRs by applying the same methods to present-day and future satellite measurements.<br/><br/>\nFundamental CDRs are composed of sensor data (e.g. calibrated radiances, brightness temperatures) that have been improved and quality controlled over time, together with ancillary calibration data.\n",

    "Description": "Gridded (adjusted) sea level anomaly (GSLA), gridded sea level (GSL) and surface geostrophic velocity (UCUR,VCUR) for the Australasian region. GSLA is mapped using optimal interpolation of detided, de-meaned, inverse-barometer-adjusted altimeter and tidegauge estimates of sea level. GSL is GSLA plus an estimate of the departure of mean sea level from the geoid – mean sea level (over 18 years of model time) of Ocean Forecasting Australia Model version 3 (OFAM3). The geostrophic velocities are derived from GSLA and the mean surface velocity from OFAM3. \n\n\nThe altimeter data window for input to the Delayed Mode (DM) maps is symmetrical about the map date. The width of the window is dependent on the number of altimeters flying at the time and ranges from 30 days to 14 days. The altimeter data window for Near Real Time (NRT) maps is asymmetrical about the analysis date (-21 to 4 days). For both NRT and DM, altimeter data is weighted by the difference between the analysis date of the map and the time of each altimeter observation.\n\nReferences: http://imos.aodn.org.au/oceancurrent",

    "Description": "The Rottnest Shelf (ROT) HF ocean radar system covers an area which includes Rottnest Island and the Perth Canyon to the north-west.  The Perth Canyon has the highest marine biodiversity in the region with whale and fish aggregations, and high primary and secondary productions which are controlled by the physical oceanographic processes.  \n\nCombined with the dynamics of the Perth Canyon is the dominant Leeuwin Current which produces a wake on the leeward side of Rottnest Island.   This is a topographically induced up-welling and associated primary and secondary productivity.  The region is influenced by Swan River outflow, submarine groundwater discharges , and waste-water outfalls.  \n\nThe ROT HF ocean radar is a WERA phased array system with 16-element receive arrays located at Fremantle (32.031 S, 115.746 E) and Guilderton (31.342 S, 115.489 E).  These radars operate at a frequency of 8.512 MHz, with a bandwidth of 33 KHz and a maximum range of 200 Km.  Within the HF radar coverage area surface currents are measured.  Data are also collected from which wind directions and significant wave height can be calculated.  \n\nThe ROT area of coverage has a small overlap of commonly observed ocean with the Turqoise Coast (TURQ) SeaSonde HF ocean radar system on its north side.  Together, the ROT and TURQ systems provide continuous monitoring of the shelf from Fremantle to Jurien Bay.",

    "Name": "Ocean Radar - South Australian gulfs site - Wind - Delayed mode",
    "Description": "The South Australia Gulfs (SAG) HF ocean radar system covers the area of about 40,000 square kilometres bounded by Kangaroo Island to the east and the Eyre Peninsula to the north.  This is a dynamic region where warm water from the remnants of the Leeuwin current is moving from the west, and water with varying density is exchanging with Spencer Gulf and the Gulf of St Vincent.  Upwelling events occur from the deep ocean on the south side of the observation area.  This is a key ocean area for aquaculture and fishing, and is a major shipping thoroughfare.  The data from this HF ocean radar system link the dynamics of the Great Australian Bight to the Bonney Coast and on to Tasmania. \n\nSpecific research questions identified by the SA Node of IMOS are: What is the detailed connection between shelf currents and the Flinders Current to non-regional influences (e.g. Southern Ocean, WA)?  What is the nature of oceanic currents and processes (e.g. wave drift, mixing, eddies) that drive both winter and summer cross and along shelf exchange including the summertime upwelling systems and flushing of the gulfs?  How does the ocean circulation, wave drift, eddies and environmental variability affect the distribution of sediments, nutrients, the production of lower trophic levels\n(phytoplankton and zooplankton), the dispersal of larvae that underpin productive fisheries in the region and the effects of environment on aquaculture\n\nThe SAG HF ocean radar is a WERA phased array system with 16-element receive arrays located at Cape Wiles (34.943 S, 135.681 E) and Cape Spencer (35.294 S, 136.879 E).  These radars operate at a frequency of 8.512 MHz, with a bandwidth of 33 KHz and a maximum range of 200 Km.  Within the HF radar coverage area surface currents are measured.  Data are also collected from which wind directions and significant wave height can be calculated.  \n\nMost of the capital was contributed by the South Australia Research and Development Institute.",

    "Description": "The Observational Products for End-Users from Remote Sensing Analysis ([OPERA](https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/go/opera)) Land Surface Disturbance Annual from Harmonized Landsat Sentinel-2 (HLS) product Version 1 summarizes the [DIST-ALERT](https://doi.org/10.5067/SNWG/OPERA_L3_DIST-ALERT-HLS_V1.001) data product into an annual vegetation disturbance data product. Vegetation disturbance is mapped when there is an indicated decrease in vegetation cover within an HLS Version 2 pixel. The product also provides auxiliary generic disturbance information as determined from the variations of the reflectance through the DIST-ALERT scenes to provide information about more general disturbance trends. The DIST-ANN product tracks changes at the annual scale, aggregating changes identified in the DIST-ALERT product. Only confirmed disturbances from the associated year are reported together with the date of initial disturbance. As confirmed disturbances are determined using subsequent cloud-free observations to determine if the loss detections persist, the required number of HLS scenes depends on visibility of the target. Due to this dependency, summarizing the DIST-ALERT in the DIST-ANN product will have some latency contingent on the algorithmic calibration and is detailed in the Algorithm Theoretical Basis Document (ATBD).\n\nThe OPERA_L3_DIST-ANN-HLS (or DIST-ANN) data product is provided in Cloud Optimized GeoTIFF (COG) format, and each layer is distributed as a separate COG. There are 21 layers contained within the DIST-ANN product: vegetation disturbance status, historical vegetation cover indicator, maximum vegetation cover indicator, maximum vegetation anomaly value, vegetation disturbance confidence layer, date of initial vegetation disturbance, number of detected vegetation loss anomalies, vegetation disturbance duration, date of last observation assessed for vegetation disturbance, and several generic disturbance layers. Each product layer is gridded to the same resolution and tiling system as HLS V2: 30 meter (m) and Military Grid Reference System (MGRS). See the Product Specification Document (PSD) for a more detailed description of the individual layers provided in the DIST-ANN product. \n\nThe OPERA_L3_DIST-ANN-HLS product contains modified Copernicus Sentinel data (2020-2025).\n\nKnown Issues\n* Additional usage constraints are provided under Section 5 of the Algorithm Theoretical Basis Document (ATBD).\nRead our doc on how to get AWS Credentials to retrieve this data: https://data.lpdaac.earthdatacloud.nasa.gov/s3credentialsREADME",

    "Description": "CTD (Conductivity-Temperature_Depth)-Satellite Relay Data Loggers (CTD-SRDLs) are used to explore how marine animal behaviour relates to their oceanic environment. Loggers developed at the University of St Andrews Sea Mammal Research Unit transmit data in near real-time via the Argo satellite system. Data represented here was collected in the Southern Ocean, from elephant, fur and Weddell Seals. In 2024 data was added from flatback and olive ridley turtles, from a pilot study co-funded by the Royal Australian Navy in collaboration with the Australian Institute of Marine Science and Indigenous Ranger groups.\n\nData parameters measured by the instruments include time, conductivity (salinity), temperature, pressure and depth. The data represented by this record have been Qc'd and are the Australian subset of the MEOP-CTD database (MEOP: Marine Mammals Exploring the Oceans Pole to Pole), complemented with the most recent Southern Ocean deployment data. This Australian subset of the Southern Ocean database represents about one quarter of the entire MEOP-CTD database, which currently is about 52,000 profiles obtained from 275 CTD-SRDL tag deployments. The Australian dataset originated in 2004, and was initially collected by Mark Hindell's team based at the University of Tasmania, and in later years his data has formed part of the Animal Tracking Facility of Integrated Marine Observing System (IMOS).",

Here, using single-cell RNA/TCR/BCR-seq with protein feature barcoding (20 antibodies), we profiled 317 samples from 166 healthy individuals aged 25 to 85 years old drawn over 3-year period. Dataset spanning ~2 million cells describes 50 subpopulations of blood immune cells, with 14 subpopulations changing with age, including a novel NKG2C+ CD8 Tcm population that decreases with age. We describe age-associated accumulation of Th2 and HLA-DR+ memory CD4 T cells, CCR4+ CD8 Tcm cells and GZMK+ CD8 Tem cells. We validate key findings using 30-plex spectral cytometry panel. We characterize patterns of antigen receptor clonality across subpopulations of T and B cells and describe their age-dependence. Our work provides novel insights into healthy human aging and unique annotated resource of unprecedented depth.",

    "Name": "Global Seasonal Sentinel-1 Interferometric Coherence and Backscatter Data Set",
    "Description": "This data set is the first-of-its-kind spatial representation of multi-seasonal, global SAR repeat-pass interferometric coherence and backscatter signatures. Global coverage comprises all land masses and ice sheets from 82 degrees northern to 79 degrees southern latitude. The data set is derived from high-resolution multi-temporal repeat-pass interferometric processing of about 205,000 Sentinel-1 Single-Look-Complex data acquired in Interferometric Wide-Swath mode (Sentinel-1 IW mode) from 1-Dec-2019 to 30-Nov-2020. The data set was developed by [Earth Big Data LLC](https://earthbigdata.com) and [Gamma Remote Sensing AG](https://www.gamma-rs.ch), under contract for [NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory](https://jpl.nasa.gov). The data set covers four sets of seasonal (DJF/MAM/JJA/SON) metrics: 1) Median 6-, 12-, 18-, 24-, 36-, and 48-day repeat coherence estimates for C-band VV and HH polarized data, 2) Mean backscatter (gamma naught) for VV, VH, HH, and HV polarizations, 3) Seasonal coherence decay model parameters rho, tau, and rmse, 4) Local incidence and layover/shadow regions for all relative orbits (175 orbits). Note that in the data set filenames the seasons were referred to as northern hemisphere winter (DJF), spring (MAM), summer (JJA), and fall (SON). The data set is available in two main components: 1) 1x1 degree tiles. Each tile contains GeoTiffs at 3 arcsec pixel spacing of all metrics available in the tile. (s3://sentinel-1-global-coherence-earthbigdata/data/tiles/), 2) Global mosaicked tiles as cloud optimized GeoTIFFs (COG) at 0.01 degree pixel spacing (s3://sentinel-1-global-coherence-earthbigdata/data/mosaics/) for each of the computed metrics.\n",

The DE-SynPUF was created with the goal of providing a realistic set of claims data in the public domain while providing the very highest degree of protection to the Medicare beneficiaries’ protected health information.  The purposes of the DE-SynPUF are to: \n1. allow data entrepreneurs to develop and create software and applications that may eventually be applied to actual CMS claims data;\n2. train researchers on the use and complexity of conducting analyses with CMS claims data prior to initiating the process to obtain access to actual CMS data; and,\n3. support safe data mining innovations that may reveal unanticipated knowledge gains while preserving beneficiary privacy.\nThe files have been designed so that programs and procedures created on the DE-SynPUF will function on CMS Limited Data Sets. The data structure of the Medicare DE-SynPUF is very similar to the CMS Limited Data Sets, but with a smaller number of variables.  The DE-SynPUF also provides a robust set of metadata on the CMS claims data that have not been previously available in the public domain.  Although the DE-SynPUF has very limited inferential research value to draw conclusions about Medicare beneficiaries due to the synthetic processes used to create the file, the Medicare DE-SynPUF does increase access to a realistic Medicare claims data file in a timely and less expensive manner to spur the innovation necessary to achieve the goals of better care for beneficiaries and improve the health of the population.\n",

Meta combines the work of global contributors to projects like OpenStreetMap with quality and consistency checks from Daylight mapping partners to create a free, stable, and easy-to-use street-scale global map. <br/><br/>\nThe Daylight Map Distribution contains a validated subset of the OpenStreetMap database. In addition to the standard OpenStreetMap PBF format, Daylight is available in two parquet formats that are optimized for AWS Athena including geometries (Points, LineStrings, Polygons, or MultiPolygons). First, **Daylight OSM Features** contains the nearly 1B renderable OSM features. Second, **Daylight OSM Elements** contains all of OSM, including all 7B nodes without attributes, and relations that do not contain geometries, such as turn restrictions. <br/><br/> \nDaylight Earth Table is a new data schema that classifies OpenStreetMap-style tags into a 3-level ontology (theme, class, subclass) and is the result of running the earth table classification over the latest release (v1.18) of the Daylight Map Distribution. The Daylight Earth Table is available as parquet files on Amazon S3. \n",

    "Name": "NOAA Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellites (GOES) 16, 17, 18 & 19",
    "Description": "<br/>\n<br/> \nNEW GOES-19 Data!! On April 4, 2025 at 1500 UTC, the GOES-19 satellite will be declared the Operational GOES-East satellite. All products and services, including NODD, for GOES-East will transition to GOES-19 data at that time. GOES-19 will operate out of the GOES-East location of 75.2°W starting on April 1, 2025 and through the operational transition. Until the transition time and during the final stretch of Post Launch Product Testing (PLPT), GOES-19 products are considered non-operational regardless of their validation maturity level. Shortly following the transition of GOES-19 to GOES-East, all data distribution from GOES-16 will be turned off. GOES-16 will drift to the storage location at 104.7°W. GOES-19 data should begin flowing again on April 4th once this maneuver is complete. \n<br/>\n<br/>\nNEW GOES 16 Reprocess Data!! The reprocessed GOES-16 ABI L1b data mitigates systematic data issues (including data gaps and image artifacts) seen in the Operational products, and improves the stability of both the radiometric and geometric calibration over the course of the entire mission life. These data were produced by recomputing the L1b radiance products from input raw L0 data using improved calibration algorithms and look-up tables, derived from data analysis of the NIST-traceable, on-board sources. In addition, the reprocessed data products contain enhancements to the L1b file format, including limb pixels and pixel timestamps, while maintaining compatibility with the operational products. The datasets currently available span the operational life of GOES-16 ABI, from early 2018 through the end of 2024. The Reprocessed L1b dataset shows improvement over the Operational L1b products but may still contain data gaps or discrepancies. Please provide feedback to Dan Lindsey (dan.lindsey@noaa.gov) and Gary Lin (guoqing.lin-1@nasa.gov). More information can be found in the [GOES-R ABI Reprocess User Guide](https://github.com/NOAA-Big-Data-Program/nodd-data-docs/blob/main/GOES/GOES-R_ABI_Reprocessed_L1b_User_Guide-v1.1.pdf).\n<br/>\n<br/>  \nNOTICE: As of January 10th 2023, GOES-18 assumed the GOES-West position and all data files are deemed both operational and provisional, so no ‘preliminary, non-operational’ caveat is needed. GOES-17 is now offline, shifted approximately 105 degree West, where it will be in on-orbit storage. GOES-17 data will no longer flow into the GOES-17 bucket. Operational GOES-West products can be found in the GOES-18 bucket. \n<br/>\n<br/> \nGOES satellites (GOES-16, GOES-17, GOES-18 & GOES-19) provide continuous weather imagery and\nmonitoring of meteorological and space environment data across North America.\nGOES satellites provide the kind of continuous monitoring necessary for\nintensive data analysis. They hover continuously over one position on the surface.\nThe satellites orbit high enough to allow for a full-disc view of the Earth. Because\nthey stay above a fixed spot on the surface, they provide a constant vigil for the\natmospheric \"triggers\" for severe weather conditions such as tornadoes, flash floods,\nhailstorms, and hurricanes. When these conditions develop, the GOES satellites are able\nto monitor storm development and track their movements. SUVI products available in both NetCDF and FITS. \n",

Specifically, this data includes Weather Research and Forecasting Model (v4.4.2) conducted at a 12-km resolution over the Continental United States (12US). MCIP-processed files and wrfcamx-processed (12US1 domain) are also available as part of this dataset  to assist in the use of emissions processing and photochemical modeling. These files  may be used in downstream applications to generate emissions, photochemical  modeling, or dispersion modeling inputs. Additionally, lateral boundary condition files  generated using GEOS-CF at 36-km with results translated from GEOS-Chem species available  in GEOS-CF to CMAQ cb6/ae7. Simulations for boundary conditions covering the northern  hemisphere are also provided. 12US2 lateral boundary condition files are also generated based  on 36US3 CMAQ model run outputs. These simulations were conducted using CMAQ v5.4 and GEOS-Chem v14.0.1. 2022v1 CMAQ-ready emissions are provided for a 36km grid over North America (36US3)  and two 12km grids (12SU1 and 12US2). In addition, 2022v1 CAMx-ready emissions are provided  for a 12km grid over North America (12US2). See the documentation for pictures of the grids.  The types of emissions data provided include point sources, nonpoint sources, mobiles sources,  fires, lightning NOx, and biogenic emissions. Input files for computing biogenic emissions,  lightning NOx emissions and bi-directional deposition inline within CMAQ are also provided.  Ozone column and photolysis rate input files for CAMx model run are also provided. The related  CMAQ and CAMx run scripts are also available now. One day sample outputs for CMAQ and CAMx on the 12US2 domain are also now available. README text files are included at multiple  levels within the directory structure to explain files at that level.

    "Name": "GPM IMERG Final Precipitation L3 Half Hourly 0.1 degree x 0.1 degree V07 (GPM_3IMERGHH) at GES DISC",
    "Description": "Version 07B is the current version of the IMERG data sets. Older versions will no longer be available and have been superseded by Version 07.\n\nThe Integrated Multi-satellitE Retrievals for GPM (IMERG) is the unified U.S. algorithm that provides the multi-satellite precipitation product for the U.S. GPM team.\n\nThe precipitation estimates from the various precipitation-relevant satellite passive microwave (PMW) sensors comprising the GPM constellation are computed using the 2021 version of the Goddard Profiling Algorithm (GPROF2021), then gridded, intercalibrated to the GPM Combined Ku Radar-Radiometer Algorithm (CORRA) product, and merged into half-hourly 0.1°x0.1° (roughly 10x10 km) fields. Note that CORRA is adjusted to the monthly Global Precipitation Climatology Project (GPCP) Satellite-Gauge (SG) product over high-latitude ocean to correct known biases.\n\nThe half-hourly intercalibrated merged PMW estimates are then input to both a Morphing-Kalman Filter (KF) Lagrangian time interpolation scheme based on work by the Climate Prediction Center (CPC) and the Precipitation Estimation from Remotely Sensed Information using Artificial Neural Networks (PERSIANN) Dynamic Infrared–Rain Rate (PDIR) re-calibration scheme. In parallel, CPC assembles the zenith-angle-corrected, intercalibrated merged geo-IR fields and forwards them to PPS for input to the PERSIANN-CCS algorithm (supported by an asynchronous re-calibration cycle) which are then input to the KF morphing (quasi-Lagrangian time interpolation) scheme.\n\nThe KF morphing (supported by an asynchronous KF weights updating cycle) uses the PMW and IR estimates to create half-hourly estimates. Motion vectors for the morphing are computed by maximizing the pattern correlation of successive hours within each of the precipitation (PRECTOT), total precipitable liquid water (TQL), and vertically integrated vapor (TQV) data fields provided by the Modern-Era Retrospective Analysis for Research and Applications, Version 2 (MERRA-2) and Goddard Earth Observing System model Version 5 (GEOS-5) Forward Processing (FP) for the post-real-time (Final) Run and the near-real-time (Early and Late) Runs, respectively. The vectors from PRECTOT are chosen if available, else from TQL, if available, else from TQV. The KF uses the morphed data as the “forecast” and the IR estimates as the “observations”, with weighting that depends on the time interval(s) away from the microwave overpass time. The IR becomes important after about ±90 minutes away from the overpass time. Variable averaging in the KF is accounted for in a routine (Scheme for Histogram Adjustment with Ranked Precipitation Estimates in the Neighborhood, or SHARPEN) that compares the local histogram of KF morphed precipitation to the local histogram of forward- and backward-morphed microwave data and the IR.\n\nThe IMERG system is run twice in near-real time:\n\n\"Early\" multi-satellite product ~4 hr after observation time using only forward morphing and\n\"Late\" multi-satellite product ~14 hr after observation time, using both forward and backward morphing\nand once after the monthly gauge analysis is received:\n\n\"Final\", satellite-gauge product ~4 months after the observation month, using both forward and backward morphing and including monthly gauge analyses.\n\nIn V07, the near-real-time Early and Late half-hourly estimates have a monthly climatological concluding calibration based on averaging the concluding calibrations computed in the Final, while in the post-real-time Final Run the multi-satellite half-hourly estimates are adjusted so that they sum to the Final Run monthly satellite-gauge combination. In all cases the output contains multiple fields that provide information on the input data, selected intermediate fields, and estimation quality. In general, the complete calibrated precipitation, precipitation, is the data field of choice for most users.\n\nBriefly describing the Final Run, the input precipitation estimates computed from the various satellite passive microwave sensors are intercalibrated to the CORRA product (because it is presumed to be the best snapshot TRMM/GPM estimate after adjustment to the monthly GPCP SG), then \"forward/backward morphed\" and combined with microwave precipitation-calibrated geo-IR fields, and adjusted with seasonal GPCP SG surface precipitation data to provide half-hourly and monthly precipitation estimates on a 0.1°x0.1° (roughly 10x10 km) grid over the globe. Precipitation phase is a diagnostic variable computed using analyses of surface temperature, humidity, and pressure. The current period of record is June 2000 to the present (delayed by about 4 months).\nRead our doc on how to get AWS Credentials to retrieve this data: https://data.gesdisc.earthdata.nasa.gov/s3credentialsREADME",

Along with the 250 m bands are the Quality Assurance (QA) layer and five observation layers. This product is intended to be used in conjunction with the quality and viewing geometry information of the 500 m product (MYD09GA). \n\nKnown Issues\n* Prior to the Aqua MODIS launch, Band 6 exhibited several anomalous detectors. Band 6 performance degraded seriously after launch and presently a majority of the Band 6 detectors are non-functional. Science users should read and use the non-functional detector flags and decide for themselves the optimum manner to handle non-functional detector \"gaps\" for their products. For complete information please refer to the [MODIS Characterization Support Team (MCST) website](https://mcst.gsfc.nasa.gov/time-dependent-list-non-functional-or-noisy-detector).\n* For complete information about known issues please refer to the [MODIS/VIIRS Land Quality Assessment website](https://landweb.modaps.eosdis.nasa.gov/knownissue?sensor=MODIS&sat=Aqua&as=61).\n\nImprovments/Changes from Previous Version\n* The Version 6.1 Level-1B (L1B) products have been improved by undergoing various calibration changes that include: changes to the response-versus-scan angle (RVS) approach that affects reflectance bands for Aqua and Terra MODIS, corrections to adjust for the optical crosstalk in Terra MODIS infrared (IR) bands, and corrections to the Terra MODIS forward look-up table (LUT) update for the period 2012 - 2017.\n* A polarization correction has been applied to the L1B Reflective Solar Bands (RSB).\nRead our doc on how to get AWS Credentials to retrieve this data: https://data.lpdaac.earthdatacloud.nasa.gov/s3credentialsREADME",

EDDE is a collection of physics-based modeled data that represent 3D atmospheric conditions for historical and future periods under different scenarios. The EDDE Version 1 datasets cover the contiguous United States at a horizontal grid spacing of 36 kilometers at hourly increments. EDDE Version 1 includes simulations that have been dynamically downscaled from multiple global climate models (GCMs) under both mid- and high-emission scenarios from the Fifth Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP5) using the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model. Scenarios were downscaled from the Community Earth System Model (CESM) and the Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory (GFDL) Coupled Model version 3 (CM3). Simulations followed the historical periods 1975-2005 (CESM only) and 1995-2005 (both CESM and CM3), and Representative Concentration Pathways (RCP) 4.5 for 2025-2100 (CESM only), RCP6.0 for 2025-2055 (CESM only), and RCP8.5 (both CESM and CM3). Data are in Network Common Data Form (netCDF) version 4, which is used in atmospheric modeling. The EDDE data in netCDF are further written to adhere to principles of Climate and Forecasting System (CF) Compliance to enhance portability and interoperability with data from other sources.

This\nparadigm shift is critical for all power systems and is essential for grids\nwith high levels of stochastic resources. Projects will propose methods to\nquantify and manage risk at the asset level and at the system level.\n\nIn support of the ARPA-E PERFORM project, NREL has produced a set of\ntime-coincident load, wind, and solar generation profiles, including actual and\nforecasting time series. Both actuals and forecasts are provided in form of\ntime-series with high temporal and spatial fidelity. Both deterministic and\nprobabilistic forecasts are contained in the dataset.\n",

These multi-spectral measurements are used to infer the diffuse attenuation coefficient (Kd) at 490nm wavelength which provides information on how light is attenuated in the water column. It is defined as the scaling length of the exponential decrease of the downwelling irradiance, and has units (m^-1). The VIIRS K490 product estimates Kd at 490nm wavelength, using a semi-empirical model based on the ratio of water leaving radiances at 490nm and 555nm.

    "Name": "GPM IMERG Final Precipitation L3 1 day 0.1 degree x 0.1 degree V07 (GPM_3IMERGDF) at GES DISC",
    "Description": "Version 07 is the current version of the data set. Older versions will no longer be available and have been superseded by Version 07.\n\nThe Integrated Multi-satellitE Retrievals for GPM (IMERG) IMERG is a NASA product estimating global surface precipitation rates at a high resolution of 0.1° every half-hour beginning 2000.  It is part of the joint NASA-JAXA Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM) mission, using the GPM Core Observatory satellite as the standard to combine precipitation observations from an international constellation of satellites using advanced techniques.  IMERG can be used for global-scale applications as well as over regions with sparse or no reliable surface observations.  The fine spatial and temporal resolution of IMERG data allows them to be accumulated to the scale of the application for increased skill.  IMERG has three Runs with varying latencies in response to a range of application needs: rapid-response applications (Early Run, 4-h latency), same/next-day applications (Late Run, 14-h latency), and post-real-time research (Final Run, 3.5-month latency).  While IMERG strives for consistency and accuracy, satellite estimates of precipitation are expected to have lower skill over frozen surfaces, complex terrain, and coastal zones.  As well, the changing GPM satellite constellation over time may introduce artifacts that affect studies focusing on multi-year changes.\n\nThis dataset is the GPM Level 3 IMERG  *Final* Daily  10 x 10 km (GPM_3IMERGDF) derived from the half-hourly GPM_3IMERGHH.  The derived result represents the Final estimate of the daily mean precipitation rate in mm/day. The dataset is produced by first computing the mean precipitation rate in (mm/hour) in every grid cell, and then multiplying the result by 24.  This minimizes the possible dry bias in versions before \"07\", in the simple daily totals  for cells where less than 48 half-hourly observations are valid for the day. The latter under-sampling is very rare in the combined microwave-infrared and rain gauge  dataset, variable \"precipitation\",  and appears in higher latitudes. Thus, in most cases users of global \"precipitation\" data will not notice any difference. This correction, however, is noticeable in the high-quality microwave retrieval, variable \"MWprecipitation\", where the occurrence of less than 48 valid half-hourly samples per day is very common. The counts of the valid half-hourly samples per day have always been provided as a separate variable, and users of daily data were advised to pay close attention to that variable and use it to calculate the correct precipitation daily rates. Starting with version \"07\", this is done in production to minimize possible misinterpretations of the data. The counts are still provided in the data, but they are only given to gauge the significance of the daily rates, and reconstruct the simple totals if someone wishes to do so. \n\nThe latency of the derived *Final* Daily product depends on the delivery of the IMERG *Final* Half-Hourly product GPM_IMERGHH. Since the latter are delivered in a batch, once per month for the entire month, with up to 4 months latency, so will be the latency for the Final Daily, plus about 24 hours. Thus, e.g. the Dailies for January  can be expected to appear no earlier than April 2. \n\nThe daily mean rate (mm/day) is derived by first computing the mean precipitation rate (mm/hour) in a grid cell for the data day, and then multiplying the result by 24.  Thus, for every grid cell we have                \n\nPdaily_mean     = SUM{Pi * 1[Pi valid]} / Pdaily_cnt  * 24, i=[1,Nf]\n\nWhere:\nPdaily_cnt = SUM{1[Pi valid]}\n\nPi              - half-hourly input, in (mm/hr)\nNf              - Number of half-hourly files per day, Nf=48\n1[.]            - Indicator function; 1 when Pi is valid, 0 otherwise\nPdaily_cnt      - Number of valid retrievals in a grid cell per day.\n\nGrid cells for which Pdaily_cnt=0, are set to fill value in the Daily files.\nNote that Pi=0 is a valid value.\n\nPdaily_cnt are provided in the data files as variables \"precipitation_cnt\" and \"MWprecipitation_cnt\", for correspondingly the microwave-IR-gauge and microwave-only retrievals. They are only given to gauge the significance of the daily rates, and reconstruct the simple totals if someone wishes to do so. \n\nThere are various ways the daily error could be estimated from the source half-hourly random error (variable \"randomError\"). The daily error provided in the data files is calculated in a fashion similar to the daily mean precipitation rate. First, the mean of the squared half-hourly \"randomError\"  for the day is computed, and the resulting (mm^2/hr) is converted to (mm^2/day). Finally, square root is taken to get the result in (mm/day):\n\nPerr_daily = { SUM{ (Perr_i)^2 * 1[Perr_i valid] ) } / Ncnt_err  * 24}^0.5, i=[1,Nf]\nNcnt_err   = SUM( 1[Perr_i valid] )\n\nwhere:\nPerr_i\t\t- half-hourly input, \"randomError\", (mm/hr)\nPerr_daily\t- Magnitude of the daily error, (mm/day)\nNcnt_err\t\t- Number of valid half-hour error estimates\n\nAgain, the sum of squared \"randomError\" can be reconstructed, and other estimates can be derived using the available counts in the Daily files.\n\nRead our doc on how to get AWS Credentials to retrieve this data: https://data.gesdisc.earthdata.nasa.gov/s3credentialsREADME",

    "Description": "The flagship Numerical Weather Prediction model developed and used at the Met Office, is the Unified Model, the same model is used for both weather and climate prediction. For weather forecasting the Met Office runs several configurations of the Unified Model as part of its operational Numerical Weather Prediction suite. Uncovering 2 years' worth of historical data, updated regularly with a time delay. The Global deterministic model is a global configuration of the Met Office Unified Models providing the most accurate short range deterministic forecast by any national meteorological service covering a six-day period. It can produce selected hourly data covering the first 48 hours at surface level and at standard pressure levels twice a day. The model’s initial state is kept close to the real atmosphere using hybrid 4D-Var data assimilation. Formatted via NetCDF. Please note this is a public beta and therefore a non-operational service.",

    "Description": "Agriculture-Vision aims to be a publicly available large-scale aerial agricultural image dataset that is high-resolution, multi-band, and with multiple types of patterns annotated by agronomy experts.  The original dataset affiliated with the 2020 CVPR paper includes 94,986 512x512images sampled from 3,432 farmlands with nine types of annotations: double plant, drydown, endrow, nutrient deficiency, planter skip, storm damage, water, waterway and weed cluster.  All of these patterns have substantial impacts on field conditions and the final yield. These farmland images were captured between 2017 and 2019 across multiple growing seasons in numerous farming locations in the US.  Each field image contains four color channels: Near-infrared (NIR), Red, Green and Blue.  We first randomly split the 3,432 farmland images with a 6/2/2 train/val/test ratio. We then assign each sampled image to the split of the farmland image they are cropped from. This guarantees that no cropped images from the same farmland will appear in multiple splits in the final dataset.  The generated (supervised) Agriculture-Vision dataset thus contains 56,944/18,334/19,708 train/val/test images.\nAdditionally, we continue to grow this dataset.  In 2021 as a part of the [Prize Challenge at CVPR](https://www.agriculture-vision.com/agriculture-vision-2021/prize-challenge-2021), we have added sequences of full-field imagery across 52 fields to promote the use of weakly supervised methods.\n",

It supports [multiple applications](https://ufs.epic.noaa.gov/applications/) with different forecast durations and spatial domains. The [Global Data Assimilation System (GDAS)](https://github.com/NOAA-EMC/GDASApp) Application (App) is being used as the basis for uniting the [Global Workflow](http://NOAA-EMC/global-workflow) and Global Forecast System (GFS) model with [Joint Effort for Data assimilation Integration (JEDI)](https://jointcenterforsatellitedataassimilation-jedi-docs.readthedocs-hosted.com/en/latest/) capabilities.\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThe National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) use GDAS to interpolate data from various observing systems and instruments onto a three-dimensional grid. GDAS obtains its data through several observation types: surface, balloon, wind profilers, aircraft reports, buoys, radar, and satellite. This gridded output data is then used to initialize the GFS model. GDAS can be used in standalone mode to run forward operators and variational data assimilation (DA) for evaluation/development purposes. In the GDAS App, it supports GFS/GDAS cycled forecasts in the Global Workflow. Currently, GDAS primarily uses GSI for its data assimilation and cycling, but efforts are underway to replace GSI with JEDI. \n",

    "Name": "NOAA Global Surface Summary of Day",
    "Description": "Global Surface Summary of the Day is derived from The Integrated Surface Hourly (ISH) dataset. The ISH dataset includes global data obtained from the USAF Climatology Center, located in the Federal Climate Complex with NCDC. The latest daily summary data are normally available 1-2 days after the date-time of the observations used in the daily summaries. The online data files begin with 1929 and are at the time of this writing at the Version 8 software level. Over 9000 stations' data are typically available. The daily elements included in the dataset (as available from each station) are: <br/>\nMean temperature (.1 Fahrenheit) <br/>\nMean dew point (.1 Fahrenheit) <br/>\nMean sea level pressure (.1 mb) <br/>\nMean station pressure (.1 mb) <br/>\nMean visibility (.1 miles) <br/>\nMean wind speed (.1 knots) <br/>\nMaximum sustained wind speed (.1 knots) <br/>\nMaximum wind gust (.1 knots) <br/>\nMaximum temperature (.1 Fahrenheit) <br/>\nMinimum temperature (.1 Fahrenheit) <br/>\nPrecipitation amount (.01 inches) <br/>\nSnow depth (.1 inches) <br/>\nIndicator for occurrence of: Fog, Rain or Drizzle, Snow or Ice Pellets, Hail, Thunder, Tornado/Funnel Cloud.<br/><br/>\nGlobal summary of day data for 18 surface meteorological elements are derived from the synoptic/hourly observations contained in USAF DATSAV3 Surface data and Federal Climate Complex Integrated Surface Hourly (ISH). Historical data are generally available for 1929 to the present, with data from 1973 to the present being the most complete. For some periods, one or more countries' data may not be available due to data restrictions or communications problems. In deriving the summary of day data, a minimum of 4 observations for the day must be present (allows for stations which report 4 synoptic observations/day). Since the data are converted to constant units (e.g, knots), slight rounding error from the originally reported values may occur (e.g, 9.9 instead of 10.0). The mean daily values described below are based on the hours of operation for the station. For some stations/countries, the visibility will sometimes 'cluster' around a value (such as 10 miles) due to the practice of not reporting visibilities greater than certain distances. The daily extremes and totals--maximum wind gust, precipitation amount, and snow depth--will only appear if the station reports the data sufficiently to provide a valid value. Therefore, these three elements will appear less frequently than other values. Also, these elements are derived from the stations' reports during the day, and may comprise a 24-hour period which includes a portion of the previous day. The data are reported and summarized based on Greenwich Mean Time (GMT, 0000Z - 2359Z) since the original synoptic/hourly data are reported and based on GMT.\n",

    "Name": "NOAA National Water Model CONUS Retrospective Dataset",
    "Description": "The NOAA National Water Model Retrospective dataset contains input and output from multi-decade CONUS retrospective simulations. These simulations used meteorological input fields from meteorological retrospective datasets. The output frequency and fields available in this historical NWM dataset differ from those contained in the real-time operational NWM forecast model. Additionally, note that no streamflow or other data assimilation is performed within any of the NWM retrospective simulations\n<br/>\n<br/>\nOne application of this dataset is to provide historical context to current near real-time streamflow, soil moisture and snowpack conditions. The retrospective data can be used to infer flow frequencies and perform temporal analyses with hourly streamflow output and 3-hourly land surface output. This dataset can also be used in the development of end user applications which require a long baseline of data for system training or verification purposes. <br />\n<br/>\n<br/>\nDetails for Each Version of the NWM Retrospective Output\n<br/>\n<br/>\n**CONUS Domain** - CONUS retrospective output is provided by all four versions of the NWM\n<br/>\n1) Version 3.0 - A 44-year (February 1979 through January 2023) retrospective simulation using version 3.0 of the National Water Model.\n2) Version 2.1 - A 42-year (February 1979 through December 2020) retrospective simulation using version 2.1 of the National Water Model.\n3) Version 2.0 - A 26-year (January 1993 through December 2018) retrospective simulation using version 2.0 of the National Water Model.\n4) Version 1.2 - A 25-year (January 1993 through December 2017) retrospective simulation using version 1.2 of the National Water Model.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n**oCOUNS Domains** - Only v3.0 of the NWM Retrospective data set provides coverage of the NWM Alaska, Hawaii and Puerto Rico / US Virgin Island domains.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n**CONUS Meteorological Forcing**\n1) Versions 3.0 and 2.1:  NWM Retrospective simulations used forcing from the Office of Water Prediction Analysis of Record for Calibration (AORC) dataset.  NWM v2.1 used AORC v1.0 for 1979-2006 and AORC v1.1 for 2007-2020, while NWM v3.0 used AORC v1.1 for the full v3.0  (1979-2023 period)\n**Important Warning** - While the metadata tag in the NWM v3.0 forcing files label the files as “v2.1”, the files are in fact v3.0 forcing files.\n2) Versions 2.0 and 1.2 -  NWM Retrospective simulation uses forcing from the North American Land Data Assimilation System (NLDAS) dataset\n<br/>\n**oCONUS Meteorological Forcing**\n1) Version 3.0 -  AORC Alaska forcing was used to drive the NWM Alaska simulation, while North American Regional Reanalysis (NARR) data along with precipitation from the Alaska Pacific River Forecast Center (APRFC) was used to drive the Hawaii retrospective simulation.  Similarly, the Puerto Rico / US Virgin Island retrospective simulation was driven by NARR data along with precipitation from the Southeast River Forecast Center.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n**Formats** - NWM Retrospective data is available in two formats, NetCDF and Zarr.  The NetCDF files contain the full set of NWM output data, while the Zarr files contain a subset of NWM output fields that vary with model version.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n1) NWM V3.0:  All model output and forcing input fields are available in the NetCDF format.  All model output fields along with the precipitation forcing field are available in the Zarr format.\n2) NWM V2.1:  All model output and forcing input fields are available in the NetCDF format.  Many of the model output fields along with the precipitation forcing field are available in the Zarr format\n3) NWM V2.0:  All model output fields are available in NetCDF format.  Model channel output including streamflow and related fields are available in Zarr format.\n4) NWM V1.2:  All model output fields are available in NetCDF format.\n<br/>\n<br/>\nA table listing the data available within each NetCDF and Zarr file is located in the '[documentation page](https://github.com/NOAA-Big-Data-Program/bdp-data-docs/blob/main/nwm/README.md)'.  This data includes meteorological NWM forcing inputs along with NWM hydrologic and land surface outputs, and varies by version number. \n",

    "Name": "Hybrid statistical-dynamic downscaling based on multi-model ensembles in Southeast Asia",
    "Description": "GCMs under CMIP6 have been widely used to investigate climate change impacts and put forward associated adaptation and mitigation strategies. However, the relatively coarse spatial resolutions (usually 100~300km) preclude their direct applications at regional scales, which are exactly where the analysis (e.g., hydrological model simulation) is performed. To bridge this gap, a typical approach is to ‘refine’ the information from GCMs through regional climate downscaling experiments, which can be conducted statistically, dynamically, or a combination thereof. Statistical downscaling establishes relationships between large-scale climate indicators and small-scale climate variables in the reference (historical) period. Subsequently, these relationships are kept unchanged in the future and used to predict the future variables. On the other hand, dynamical downscaling operates based on the physical processes and the associated interactions in the climate systems and thus can produce a full set of regional climate simulations (e.g., temperature and precipitation fields) that are dynamically consistent. However, traditional dynamical downscaling contains significant biases that are transferred from GCMs and may be enhanced during the process of downscaling, thus degrading the downscaled results. One promising approach to remove these biases is the hybrid statistical-dynamical downscaling method, where GCMs are firstly bias-corrected, and subsequently used as lower and lateral boundary conditions to drive the regional climate models (RCMs).\n\nIn this work, we apply a hybrid statistical-dynamical downscaling method, following the approach of Xu et al. 2021. The bias-corrected dataset is adjusted to resemble ERA5-based mean climate and interannual variance, and with a non-linear trend from the ensemble mean of the 14 CMIP6 models. The dataset spans a historical period of 1979–2014 and future scenarios (SSP585) of 2015–2100, with a temporal scale of six-hour.\n\nThe main contributions of this dataset are twofold. First, we provide the open-source and high-resolution (12.5km: Southeast Asia; 2.5km:Southern Malay Peninsula; 500m: Singapore, as shown in the following Figures) datasets, including precipitation, wind, temperature, radiation, etc. Second, through our experiment, this bias-corrected and downscaled dataset is of exceptional quality compared to that of the existing dynamical scaling work (e.g., CORDEX) in southeast Asia in terms of its ability to reproduce regional climate extremes, spatial patterns, etc. This dataset will be useful for policy-makers and researchers to establish the necessary pathways for resilient planning in order to mitigate the dire impacts of climate change.\n",

Data are temporally weighted to the ninth day of the retrieval period which is reflected in the Julian date in the file name. MCD43A1 provides the three model weighting parameters (isotropic, volumetric, and geometric) used to derive the Albedo ([MCD43A3](https://doi.org/10.5067/MODIS/MCD43A3.061)) and Nadir BRDF-Adjusted Reflectance (NBAR) ([MCD43A4](https://doi.org/10.5067/MODIS/MCD43A4.061)) products.\n\nUsers are urged to use the band specific quality flags to isolate the highest quality full inversion results for their own science applications as described in the [User Guide](https://www.umb.edu/spectralmass/modis-user-guide-v006-and-v0061/mcd43a1-brdfalbedo-model-parameters-product/).\n\nThe MCD43A1 provides the three model weighting parameters for MODIS spectral bands 1 through 7 as well as the visible, near infrared (NIR), and shortwave bands. Along with the three-dimensional parameter layers for these bands are the simplified mandatory quality layers for each of the 10 bands. Essential quality information provided in the corresponding [MCD43A2](https://doi.org/10.5067/MODIS/MCD43A2.061) data file should be consulted when using this product. \n\nKnown Issues\n\n* For complete information about known issues please refer to the [MODIS/VIIRS Land Quality Assessment website](https://landweb.modaps.eosdis.nasa.gov/knownissue?sensor=MODIS&sat=TerraAqua&as=61).\n\nImprovements/Changes from Previous Versions\n\n* The Version 6.1 Level-1B (L1B) products have been improved by undergoing various calibration changes that include: changes to the response-versus-scan angle (RVS) approach that affects reflectance bands for Aqua and Terra MODIS, corrections to adjust for the optical crosstalk in Terra MODIS infrared (IR) bands, and corrections to the Terra MODIS forward look-up table (LUT) update for the period 2012 - 2017.\n* A polarization correction has been applied to the L1B Reflective Solar Bands (RSB).\nRead our doc on how to get AWS Credentials to retrieve this data: https://data.lpdaac.earthdatacloud.nasa.gov/s3credentialsREADME",

    "Name": "CryoET Data Portal",
    "Description": "Cryo-electron tomography (cryoET) is a powerful technique for visualizing 3D structures of cellular macromolecules at near atomic resolution in their native environment. Observing the inner workings of cells in context enables better understanding about the function of healthy cells and the changes associated with disease. However, the analysis of cryoET data remains a significant bottleneck, particularly the annotation of macromolecules within a set of tomograms, which often requires a laborious and time-consuming process of manual labelling that can take months to complete. Given the current success of machine learning (ML) methods for image analysis, it seems likely that ML will have a significant impact on resolving this bottleneck. The scientific community has expressed the need to encourage further ML algorithm development by providing large training sets of annotated cryoET data in standardized formats. In response to this, we (the Chan Zuckerberg Institute for Advanced Biological Imaging & Chan Zuckerberg Initiative Foundation) have established the CryoET Data Portal (https://cryoetdataportal.czscience.com/) to provide biologists and developers open access to high-quality, standardized, annotated data that can be readily used to retrain or develop new annotation models and algorithms.",

Users are encouraged to use the [OPERA_L3_DIST-ALERT-HLS V1](https://doi.org/10.5067/SNWG/OPERA_L3_DIST-ALERT-HLS_V1.001) data product which was released on March 14, 2024, and has achieved stage 1 validation.\n\nThe Observational Products for End-Users from Remote Sensing Analysis (OPERA) Land Surface Disturbance Alert from Harmonized Landsat Sentinel-2 (HLS) provisional data product Version 0 maps vegetation disturbance alerts from data collected by Landsat 8 and Landsat 9 Operational Land Imager (OLI) and Sentinel-2A, Sentinel-2B, and Sentinel-2C Multi-Spectral Instrument (MSI). Vegetation disturbance alert is detected at 30 meter (m) spatial resolution when there is an indicated decrease in vegetation cover within an HLS pixel. The product also provides auxiliary generic disturbance information as determined from the variations of the reflectance through the HLS scenes to provide information about more general disturbance trends. HLS data represent the highest temporal frequency data available at medium spatial resolution. The combined observations will provide greater sensitivity to land changes, whether of large magnitude/short duration, or small magnitude/long duration. \n\nThe OPERA_L3_DIST-ALERT-HLS (or DIST-ALERT) data product is provided in Cloud Optimized GeoTIFF (COG) format, and each layer is distributed as a separate file. There are 19 layers contained within in the DIST-ALERT product: vegetation disturbance status, current vegetation cover indicator, current vegetation anomaly value, historical vegetation cover indicator, max vegetation anomaly value, vegetation disturbance confidence layer, date of initial vegetation disturbance, number of detected vegetation loss anomalies, and vegetation disturbance duration. See the Product Specification for a more detailed description of the individual layers provided in the DIST-ALERT product. \n\nKnown Issues\n* Additional usage constraints are provided under Section 5 of the Algorithm Theoretical Basis Document (ATBD).\nRead our doc on how to get AWS Credentials to retrieve this data: https://data.lpdaac.earthdatacloud.nasa.gov/s3credentialsREADME",

To accomplish this task, microbial community samples were isolated from a cohort of 300 healthy adult human subjects at 18 specific sites within five regions of the body (oral cavity, airways, urogenital track, skin, and gut). Targeted sequencing of the 16S bacterial marker gene and/or whole metagenome shotgun sequencing was performed for thousands of these samples. In addition, whole genome sequences were generated for isolate strains collected from human body sites to act as reference organisms for analysis. Finally, 16S marker and whole metagenome sequencing was also done on additional samples from people suffering from several disease conditions.",

    "Description": "The HYSPLIT model is a complete system for computing simple air parcel trajectories, as well as complex transport, dispersion, chemical transformation, and deposition simulations. HYSPLIT continues to be one of the most extensively used atmospheric transport and dispersion models in the atmospheric sciences community. A common application is a back trajectory analysis to determine the origin of air masses and establish source-receptor relationships. HYSPLIT has also been used in a variety of simulations describing the atmospheric transport, dispersion, and deposition of pollutants and hazardous materials. Some examples of the applications include tracking and forecasting the release of radioactive material, wildfire smoke, windblown dust, pollutants from various stationary and mobile emission sources, allergens and volcanic ash.\nThe National Weather Service's National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) runs a series of computer analyses and forecasts operationally. NOAA's Air Resources Laboratory (ARL) routinely uses NCEP model data for use in air quality transport and dispersion modeling calculations. In 1989 ARL began to archive some of these datasets for future research studies. ARL has in the past, or is presently archiving the following NCEP datasets that are compatible with HYSPLIT. A few datasets that are created outside NOAA are also included. HYSPLIT-compatible meteorological datasets are required to run HYSPLIT for trajectory or dispersion simulations. The HYSPLIT-compatible meteorological datasets can also be used with HYSPLIT utilities to display and/or extract meteorological data from the datasets.\n",

    "Description": "The Observational Products for End-Users from Remote Sensing Analysis (OPERA) Coregistered Single-Look Complex (CSLC) from Sentinel-1 (S1) Static Layers (CSLC-S1-STATIC) validated product contains static radar geometry layers associated with the OPERA Coregistered Single-Look Complex (CSLC) from Sentinel-1 (S1) validated product. Due to the S1 mission’s narrow orbital tube, radar-geometry layers vary slightly over time for each position on the ground, and therefore are considered static. These static layers are provided separately from the OPERA CSLC-S1 product, as they are produced only once or a limited number of times, to account for changes in the DEM, in the S1 orbit, or in the static layers generation algorithm. Each OPERA CSLC-S1-STATIC product is distributed as a Hierarchical Data Format version 5 (HDF5) file following the CF-1.8 convention containing both data raster layers and product metadata and corresponds to matching CSLC-S1 products with the same burst ID. OPERA CSLC-S1 products are available over North America which includes the USA and U.S. Territories, Canada within 200 km of the U.S. border, and all mainland countries from the southern U.S. border down to and including Panama. The CSLC-S1 products are available in the associated OPERA Coregistered Single-Look Complex from Sentinel-1 validated product (Version 1) dataset.\nRead our doc on how to get AWS Credentials to retrieve this data: https://cumulus.asf.alaska.edu/s3credentialsREADME",

    "Name": "Ocean Radar - South Australian gulfs site - Wave - Delayed mode",
    "Description": "The South Australia Gulfs (SAG) HF ocean radar system covers the area of about 40,000 square kilometres bounded by Kangaroo Island to the east and the Eyre Peninsula to the north.  This is a dynamic region where warm water from the remnants of the Leeuwin current is moving from the west, and water with varying density is exchanging with Spencer Gulf and the Gulf of St Vincent.  Upwelling events occur from the deep ocean on the south side of the observation area.  This is a key ocean area for aquaculture and fishing, and is a major shipping thoroughfare.  The data from this HF ocean radar system link the dynamics of the Great Australian Bight to the Bonney Coast and on to Tasmania. \n\nSpecific research questions identified by the SA Node of IMOS are: What is the detailed connection between shelf currents and the Flinders Current to non-regional influences (e.g. Southern Ocean, WA)?  What is the nature of oceanic currents and processes (e.g. wave drift, mixing, eddies) that drive both winter and summer cross and along shelf exchange including the summertime upwelling systems and flushing of the gulfs?  How does the ocean circulation, wave drift, eddies and environmental variability affect the distribution of sediments, nutrients, the production of lower trophic levels\n(phytoplankton and zooplankton), the dispersal of larvae that underpin productive fisheries in the region and the effects of environment on aquaculture\n\nThe SAG HF ocean radar is a WERA phased array system with 16-element receive arrays located at Cape Wiles (34.943 S, 135.681 E) and Cape Spencer (35.294 S, 136.879 E).  These radars operate at a frequency of 8.512 MHz, with a bandwidth of 33 KHz and a maximum range of 200 Km.  Within the HF radar coverage area surface currents are measured.  Data are also collected from which wind directions and significant wave height can be calculated.  \n\nMost of the capital was contributed by the South Australia Research and Development Institute.",

    "Name": "Exceptional Responders Initiative",
    "Description": "The Exceptional Responders Initiative is a pilot study to investigate the underlying molecular factors driving exceptional treatment responses of cancer patients to drug therapies. Study researchers will examine molecular profiles of tumors from patients either enrolled in a clinical trial for an investigational drug(s) and who achieved an exceptional response relative to other trial participants, or who achieved an exceptional response to a non-investigational chemotherapy. An exceptional response is defined as achievement of either a complete response or a partial response for at least 6 months duration in a trial or treatment where the overall response rate is < 10%. The hope is to discover underlying molecular features that can be further investigated and may eventually predict benefit from a given drug or class of drugs for a particular patient.\nThis pilot project will successfully characterize approximately 100 cases of tumor tissue and, when available, case-matched germline DNA. All samples will undergo whole exome sequencing, and cases with sufficient nucleic acids will undergo additional analyses (e.g. whole genome sequencing, mRNA-sequencing, mi RNA sequencing, promoter methylation analysis, SNP etc). Each case will be annotated with demographic and clinical information, along with follow-up information minimally sufficient to correlate molecular profiles with response. Both retrospective and prospective collections will be considered. The project will also accept sequencing data and clinical data from patients who have had sequencing performed outside of this project. All data will be de-identified and placed in a controlled access database so other investigators may use them for additional insights.\nClinically annotated tissue specimens meeting the criteria will be provided by groups participating in the Exceptional Cases Initiative to a Biospecimen Core Resource (BCR), which will perform quality control on the tissues, and will use a standard operating procedure to isolate nucleic acids. The nucleic acids will be shipped to a sequencing center to perform whole exome sequencing and analysis. These findings will be made available to the broader cancer research community in a controlled access database.",

    "Name": "NOAA Hurricane Analysis and Forecast System (HAFS)",
    "Description": "The last several hurricane seasons have been active with records being set for the number of tropical storms and hurricanes in the Atlantic basin.  These record-breaking seasons underscore the importance of accurate hurricane forecasting. Imperative to increased forecasting skill for hurricanes is the development of the Hurricane Forecast Analysis System or HAFS. To accelerate improvements in hurricane forecasting, this project has the following goals:\n<br /> \n<br /> \n1) To improve the HAFS. The HAFS is NOAA’s next-generation multi-scale numerical model, with data assimilation package and ocean coupling, which will provide an operational analysis and forecast out to seven days, with reliable and skillful guidance on hurricane track and intensity (including rapid intensification), storm size, genesis, storm surge, rainfall and tornadoes associated with hurricanes.\n<br /> \n<br /> \n2) To integrate into the Unified Forecasting System(UFS). The UFS is a community-based, coupled comprehensive Earth system modeling system whose numerical applications span local to global domains and predictive time scales from sub-hourly analyses to seasonal predictions. It is designed to support the Weather Enterprise and to be the source system for NOAA’s operational numerical weather prediction applications. The HAFS will be a part of UFS geared for hurricane model applications. HAFS comprises five major components; (a) High-resolution moving nest (b) High-resolution physics (c) Multi-scale data assimilation (DA) (d) 3D ocean coupling, and (e) Observations to support the DA.\n<br /> \n<br /> \n[Read about how the storm-following model improves intensity forecasts](https://www.aoml.noaa.gov/hurricane-model-that-follows-multiple-storms-improves-intensity-forecasts/)\n",

    "Name": "Satellite - Altimetry calibration and validation",
    "Description": "High precision satellite altimeter missions including TOPEX/Poseidon (T/P), Jason-1 and now OSTM/Jason-2, have contributed fundamental advances in our understanding of regional and global ocean circulation and its role in the Earth's climate and regional applications. These altimeter satellites essentially observe the height of the global oceans – as such, they have become the tool of choice for scientists to measure sea level rise – both at regional and global scales as well as giving information about ocean currents and large- and small-scale variability. The determination of changes in global mean sea level is of fundamental importance in understanding the response of the ocean to a continuing warming climate – both through thermal expansion of the ocean, melting of the major ice sheets of Greenland and Antarctica, and mountain glaciers, and redistribution of water over the continents and atmosphere. As with all scientific observations, it is vital that the measurement tool is operating within its specifications – calibration and validation is therefore an important component in this regard. \n\nThis IMOS sub-facility provides the sole southern hemisphere in situ calibration site to provide an ongoing calibration and validation data stream directly to the international (NASA and CNES sponsored) Ocean Surface Topography Science Team (OSTST). This contribution, importantly, spans multiple altimeter missions, thus enabling the assimilation of multi-mission satellite data to determine ongoing changes in sea level with flow-on effects to other uses of this data. The OSTST collectively oversees the operation and calibration of the precision altimetry missions, and ensures each of these missions is performing as accurately as possible in order to meet mission objectives. The IMOS supported calibration site in Australia is one of four primary in situ calibration/validation sites that contribute to the OSTST. The remaining sites include Harvest (USA), Corsica (France), and Gavdos (Greece). The Australian calibration site includes two comparison points where in situ data is compared against the altimeter – Bass Strait and Storm Bay. These two locations both lie on descending (N -> S) pass 088 of the satellite altimeter, and thus share similar satellite orbit characteristics. The use of these two sites allows detailed investigation into the accuracy of the altimeter over two different wave climates. The average significant wave height at Storm Bay is approximately double that observed at the comparatively sheltered Bass Strait location. One of the ongoing issues with satellite altimeter missions is the “Sea-state bias” correction which is related to wave shape and height. We plan to use the different wave climates at the two locations, coupled with the fact that some other things (such as orbit errors) are the same at both locations to improve the quality of this correction.",

    "Description": "The MYD09GA Version 6.1 product provides an estimate of the surface spectral reflectance of Aqua Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Bands 1 through 7, corrected for atmospheric conditions such as gasses, aerosols, and Rayleigh scattering. Provided along with the 500 meter (m) surface reflectance, observation, and quality bands are a set of ten 1 kilometer observation bands and geolocation flags. The reflectance layers from the MYD09GA are used as the source data for many of the MODIS land products. \n\nKnown Issues\n* Prior to the Aqua MODIS launch, Band 6 exhibited several anomalous detectors. Band 6 performance degraded seriously after launch and presently a majority of the Band 6 detectors are non-functional. Science users should read and use the non-functional detector flags and decide for themselves the optimum manner to handle non-functional detector \"gaps\" for their products. For complete information please refer to the [MODIS Characterization Support Team (MCST) website](https://mcst.gsfc.nasa.gov/time-dependent-list-non-functional-or-noisy-detector).\n* For complete information about known issues please refer to the [MODIS/VIIRS Land Quality Assessment website](https://landweb.modaps.eosdis.nasa.gov/knownissue?sensor=MODIS&sat=Aqua&as=61).\n\nImprovments/Changes from Previous Version\n* The Version 6.1 Level-1B (L1B) products have been improved by undergoing various calibration changes that include: changes to the response-versus-scan angle (RVS) approach that affects reflectance bands for Aqua and Terra MODIS, corrections to adjust for the optical crosstalk in Terra MODIS infrared (IR) bands, and corrections to the Terra MODIS forward look-up table (LUT) update for the period 2012 - 2017.\n* A polarization correction has been applied to the L1B Reflective Solar Bands (RSB).\nRead our doc on how to get AWS Credentials to retrieve this data: https://data.lpdaac.earthdatacloud.nasa.gov/s3credentialsREADME",

The data is stored in columnar storage formats (ORC) to make it straightforward to query using standard tools like Amazon Athena or Apache Spark. The data itself is originally intended to be used for building decision support tools for farmers and digital agriculture. The first dataset is the historical NDFD / NDGD data distributed by NCEP / NOAA / NWS. The NDFD (National Digital Forecast Database) and NDGD (National Digital Guidance Database) contain gridded forecasts and observations at 2.5km resolution for the Contiguous United States (CONUS). There are also 5km grids for several smaller US regions and non-continguous territories, such as Hawaii, Guam, Puerto Rico and Alaska. NOAA distributes archives of the NDFD/NDGD via its NOAA Operational Model Archive and Distribution System (NOMADS) in Grib2 format. The data has been converted to ORC to optimize storage space and to, more importantly, simplify data access via standard data analytics tools.\n",

    "Description": "M2I3NPASM (or  inst3_3d_asm_Np) is an instantaneous 3-dimensional 3-hourly data collection in Modern-Era Retrospective analysis for Research and Applications version 2 (MERRA-2).  This collection consists of assimilations of meteorological parameters at 42 pressure levels, such as  temperature, wind components, vertical pressure velocity, water vapor, ozone mass mixing ratio, and layer height. The data field is available every three hours starting from 00:00 UTC, e.g.:  00:00, 03:00, … , 21:00 UTC. The information on the pressure levels can be found in the section 4.2 of the MERRA-2 File Specification document.  \n\nMERRA-2 is the latest version of global atmospheric reanalysis for the satellite era produced by NASA Global Modeling and Assimilation Office (GMAO) using the Goddard Earth Observing System Model (GEOS) version 5.12.4.  The dataset covers the period of 1980-present with the latency of ~3 weeks after the end of a month. \n\nData Reprocessing:  Please check “Records of MERRA-2 Data Reprocessing and Service Changes” linked from the “Documentation” tab on this page.  Note that a reprocessed data filename is different from the original file.\n\nMERRA-2 Mailing List: Sign up to receive information on reprocessing of data, changing of tools and services, as well as data announcements from GMAO. Contact the GES DISC Help Desk (gsfc-dl-help-disc@mail.nasa.gov) to be added to the list.\n\nQuestions: If you have a question, please read \"MERRA-2 File Specification Document\",  “MERRA-2 Data Access – Quick Start Guide”, and FAQs linked from the ”Documentation” tab on this page.

    "Description": "The 2020 Census Redistricting Data (P.L. 94-171) Noisy Measurement File (NMF) is an intermediate output of the 2020 Census Disclosure Avoidance System (DAS) TopDown Algorithm (TDA) (as described in Abowd, J. et al [2022] https://doi.org/10.1162/99608f92.529e3cb9, and implemented in the [DAS 2020 Redistricting Production Code](https://github.com/uscensusbureau/DAS_2020_Redistricting_Production_Code)). The NMF was generated using [the Census Bureau's implementation](https://github.com/uscensusbureau/DAS_2020_Redistricting_Production_Code/blob/289ee463936a6f0efcf2e378abe410ec01d0e140/source/programs/engine/primitives.py#L183) of the [Discrete Gaussian Mechanism](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.00010), calibrated to satisfy [zero-Concentrated Differential Privacy](https://arxiv.org/abs/1605.02065) with [bounded neighbors](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/1989323.1989345).\n<br/>\n  <br/>\nThe NMF values, called **noisy measurements** are the output of applying the Discrete Gaussian Mechanism to counts from the 2020 Census Edited File (CEF). They are generally inconsistent with one another (for example, in a county composed of two tracts, the noisy measurement for the county's total population may not equal the sum of the noisy measurements of the two tracts' total population), and frequently negative (especially when the population being measured was small), but are integer-valued. The NMF was later post-processed as part of the DAS code to take the form of microdata and to satisfy various constraints. The NMF documented here contains both the noisy measurements themselves as well as the data needed to represent the DAS constraints; thus, the NMF could be used to reproduce the steps taken by the DAS code to produce microdata from the noisy measurements by applying [the production code base](https://github.com/uscensusbureau/DAS_2020_Redistricting_Production_Code/blob/289ee463936a6f0efcf2e378abe410ec01d0e140/source/).\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThe 2020 Census Redistricting Data (P.L. 94-171) Noisy Measurement File includes zero-Concentrated Differentially Private (zCDP) (Bun, M. and Steinke, T [2016]) noisy measurements, implemented via the discrete Gaussian mechanism. These are estimated counts of individuals and housing units included in the 2020 Census Edited File (CEF), which includes confidential data initially collected in the 2020 Census of Population and Housing. The noisy measurements included in this file were subsequently post-processed by the TopDown Algorithm (TDA) to produce the [2020 Census Redistricting Data (P.L. 94-171) Summary File](https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/decennial-census/about/rdo/summary-files.html).\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThe NMF provides estimates of counts of persons in the CEF by various characteristics and combinations of characteristics including their reported race and ethnicity, whether they were of voting age, whether they resided in a housing unit or one of 7 group quarters types, and their census block of residence after the addition of discrete Gaussian noise (with the scale parameter determined by the privacy-loss budget allocation for that particular query under zCDP). Noisy measurements of the counts of occupied and vacant housing units by census block are also included. Lastly, data on constraints--information into which no noise was infused by the Disclosure Avoidance System (DAS) and used by the TDA to post-process the noisy measurements into the 2020 Census Redistricting Data (P.L. 94-171) Summary File --are provided.\n",

Transcriptome profiling is done using PCR-cDNA sequencing (PCR-cDNA), amplification-free cDNA sequencing (direct cDNA), direct sequencing of native RNA (direct RNA), and short read RNA-Seq. The SG-NEx core data includes 5 of the most commonly used cell lines and it is extended with additional cell lines and samples that cover a broad range of human tissues. All core samples are sequenced with at least 3 high quality replicates. For a subset of samples spike-in RNAs are used and matched m6A profiling data is available.",

The simulation was undertaken using the open source PyFR flow solver on over 5000 Nvidia K20X GPUs of the Titan supercomputer at Oak Ridge National Laboratory under an INCITE award from the US DOE. The data can be used to develop an enhanced understanding of the complex three-dimensional unsteady air flow patterns over turbine blades in jet engines. This could in turn lead to design of greener more fuel efficient aircraft. It could also be used to train a next-generation of Reynolds Averaged Navier-Stokes turbulence models via a machine learning approach, which would have broad applicability to a wide range of science and engineering problems.",

YouTube-8M is a large-scale labeled video dataset that consists of millions of YouTube video IDs, with high-quality machine-generated annotations from a diverse vocabulary of 3,800+ visual entities. It comes with precomputed audio-visual features from billions of frames and audio segments, designed to fit on a single hard disk. This dataset also includes the YouTube-8M Segments data from June 2019. \nThis dataset is 'Lakehouse Ready'. Meaning, you can query this data in-place straight out of the Registry of Open Data S3 bucket. [Deploy this dataset's corresponding CloudFormation template](https://us-west-2.console.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/home?region=us-west-2#/stacks/quickcreate?templateUrl=https://aws-roda-ml-datalake.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/YT8MRodaTemplate.RodaTemplate.json&stackName=YT8M-RODA) to create the  AWS Glue Catalog entries into your account in about 30 seconds.

    "Description": "NSF NCAR is providing a NetCDF-4 structured version of the 0.25 degree atmospheric ECMWF Reanalysis 5 (ERA5) to the AWS ODSP. ERA5 is produced using high-resolution forecasts (HRES) at 31 kilometer resolution (one fourth the spatial resolution of the operational model) and a 62 kilometer resolution ten member 4D-Var ensemble of data assimilation (EDA) in CY41r2 of ECMWF's Integrated Forecast System (IFS) with 137 hybrid sigma-pressure (model) levels in the vertical, up to a top level of 0.01 hPa. Atmospheric data on these levels are interpolated to 37 pressure levels (the same levels as in ERA-Interim). Surface or single level data are also available, containing 2D parameters such as precipitation, 2 meter temperature, top of atmosphere radiation and vertical integrals over the entire atmosphere. The IFS is coupled to a soil model, the parameters of which are also designated as surface parameters, and an ocean wave model. Generally, the data is available at an hourly frequency and consists of analyses and short (12 hour) forecasts, initialized twice daily from analyses at 06 and 18 UTC. Most analyses parameters are also available from the forecasts. The data are provided in CF-compliant NetCDF4 format files. ERA5 products are used to train ML/AI based weather forecast models and support retrospective climate research use cases, including where to locate solar and wind farms.",

    "Description": "Blunt force abdominal trauma is among the most common types of traumatic injury, with the most frequent cause being motor vehicle accidents. Abdominal trauma may result in damage and internal bleeding of the internal organs, including the liver, spleen, kidneys, and bowel. Detection and classification of injuries are key to effective treatment and favorable outcomes. A large proportion of patients with abdominal trauma require urgent surgery. Abdominal trauma often cannot be diagnosed clinically by physical exam, patient symptoms, or laboratory tests. Prompt diagnosis of abdominal trauma using medical imaging is thus critical to patient care. AI tools that assist and expedite diagnosis of abdominal trauma have the potential to substantially improve patient care and health outcomes in the emergency setting. To create the ground truth dataset, RSNA collected imaging data sourced from 23 sites in 14 countries on six continents, including more than 4,000 CT exams with various abdominal injuries and a roughly equal number of cases without injury.",

    "Name": "Satellite - Sea surface temperature - Level 3 - Multi sensor - 3 day - Day and night time",
    "Description": "This is a multi-sensor SSTfnd L3S product for a single 72 hour period, derived using sea surface temperature retrievals from the VIIRS sensor on the Suomi-NPP satellite and JPSS series of satellites, and AVHRR sensor on the NOAA and Metop series of Polar-orbiting satellites. The sensors and satellite platforms contributing to each file are listed in the sensor and platform global attributes in the file header. The SSTfnd is derived by adding a constant 0.17 degC to the NOAA AVHRR SSTskin observations, and 0 degC to the Metop and VIIRS SSTsubskin observations, after rejecting observations with low surface wind speeds (<6 m/s by day and <2 m/s at night). The Multi-sensor L3S product is provided as a 0.02deg x 0.02deg cylindrical equidistant projected map over the region 70E to 170W, 20N to 70S. The quality level for each pixel was remapped using the original ACSPO VIIRS and AVHRR L3U quality levels and Sensor Specific Error Statistics (SSES), as described in Griffin et al. (2017) Appendix at http://imos.org.au/facilities/srs/sstproducts/sstdata0/sstdata-references/, before compositing single swaths from the sensors. Each grid cell contains the 72 hour average of all the highest available quality SSTs that overlap with that cell, weighted by the area of overlap. Refer to the IMOS SST products web page at http://imos.org.au/sstproducts.html for further information.",

    "Name": "LEarning biOchemical Prostate cAncer Recurrence from histopathology sliDes challenge (LEOPARD) Dataset",
    "Description": "\"This dataset contains the all data for the [LEarning biOchemical Prostate cAncer Recurrence from histopathology sliDes challenge or LEOPARD](https://leopard.grand-challenge.org/).Prostate cancer, impacting 1.4 million men annually, is a prevalent malignancy ([H. Sung et al., 2021](https://acsjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.3322/caac.21660)). A substantial number of these individuals undergo prostatectomy as the primary curative treatment. The efficacy of this surgery is assessed, in part, by monitoring the concentration of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) in the bloodstream. While the role of PSA in prostate cancer screening is debatable ([W. F. Clark et al., 2018;](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2680553) [E. A. M. Heijnsdijk et al., 2018](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/ijc.31102)), it serves as a valuable biomarker for postprostatectomy follow-up in patients. Following successful surgery, PSA concentration is typically undetectable (<0.1 ng/mL) within 4-6 weeks ([S. S. Goonewardene et al., 2014](https://wchh.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/tre.407)). However, approximately 30% of patients experience biochemical recurrence, signifying the resurgence of prostate cancer cells. This recurrence serves as a prognostic indicator for progression to clinical metastases and eventual prostate cancer-related mortality ([C. L. Amling, 2014;](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10840432/) [S. J. Freedland et al., 2005;](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/201291) [M. Han et al., 2001;](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0094014305701634?via%3Dihub) [T. Van den Broeck et al., 2001](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0302283818307528?via%3Dihub). Current clinical practices gauge the risk of biochemical recurrence by considering the International Society of Urological Pathology (ISUP) grade, PSA value at diagnosis, and TNM staging criteria ([J. I. Epstein et al., 2016](https://journals.lww.com/ajsp/abstract/2016/02000/the_2014_international_society_of_urological.10.aspx)). A recent European consensus guideline suggests categorizing patients into low-risk, intermediate-risk, and high-risk groups based on these factors ([N. Mottet et al., 2021](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0302283820307697?via%3Dihub)). Notably, a high ISUP grade independently assigns a patient to the intermediate (grade 2/3) or high-risk group (grade 4/5). The Gleason growth patterns, representing morphological patterns of prostate cancer, are used to categorize cancerous tissue into ISUP grade groups ([J. I. Epstein, 2010;](https://www.auajournals.org/doi/10.1016/j.juro.2009.10.046) [P. M. Pierorazio et al., 2013;](https://bjui-journals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1464-410X.2012.11611.x) [G. J. L. H. van Leenders et al., 2020;](https://journals.lww.com/ajsp/fulltext/2020/08000/the_2019_international_society_of_urological.1.aspx) [J. I. Epstein et al., 2016](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0302283815005576?via%3Dihub)). However, the ISUP grade has limitations, such as grading disagreement among pathologists ([J. I. Epstein et al., 2016](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0302283815005576?via%3Dihub)) and coarse descriptors of tissue morphology. Recently, deep learning was shown ([H. Pinckaers et al., 2022](https://www.nature.com/articles/s43856-022-00126-3); [O. Eminaga et. al., 2024](https://www.nature.com/articles/s44303-023-00005-z)) to be able to predict the biochemical recurrence of prostate cancer.  Hypothesizing that deep learning could uncover finer morphological features' prognostic value, we are organizing the LEarning biOchemical Prostate cAncer Recurrence from histopathology sliDes (LEOPARD) challenge. The goal of this challenge is to yield top-performance deep learning solutions to predict the time to biochemical recurrence from H&E-stained histopathological tissue sections, i.e. based on morphological features.\n",

    "Name": "2021 Amazon Last Mile Routing Research Challenge Dataset",
    "Description": "The 2021 Amazon Last Mile Routing Research Challenge was an innovative research initiative led by Amazon.com and supported by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology’s Center for Transportation and Logistics. Over a period of 4 months, participants were challenged to develop innovative machine learning-based methods to enhance classic optimization-based approaches to solve the travelling salesperson problem, by learning from historical routes executed by Amazon delivery drivers. The primary goal of the Amazon Last Mile Routing Research Challenge was to foster innovative applied research in route planning, building on recent advances in predictive modeling, and using a real-world problem and data. The dataset released for the research challenge includes route-, stop-, and package-level features for 9,184 historical routes performed by Amazon drivers in 2018 in five metropolitan areas in the United States. This real-world dataset excludes any personally identifiable information (all route and package identifiers have been randomly regenerated and related location data have been obfuscated to ensure anonymity). Although multiple synthetic benchmark datasets are available in the literature, the dataset of the 2021 Amazon Last Mile Routing Research Challenge is the first large and publicly available dataset to include instances based on real-world operational routing data. The dataset is fully described and formally introduced in the following Transportation Science article: https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/10.1287/trsc.2022.1173",

    "Description": "The Observational Products for End-Users from Remote Sensing Analysis (OPERA) Radiometric Terrain Corrected (RTC) SAR Backscatter from Sentinel-1 (S1) Static Layers (RTC-S1-STATIC) validated product contains static radar geometry layers associated with the OPERA Radiometric Terrain Corrected (RTC) SAR Backscatter from Sentinel-1 (S1) (RTC-S1) validated product.  Due to the S1 mission’s narrow orbital tube, radar-geometry layers such as incidence angle, local incidence angle, number of looks, and RTC Area Normalization Factor (ANF) vary slightly over time for each position on the ground, and therefore are considered static. These static layers are provided separately from the OPERA RTC-S1 product, as they are produced only once or a limited number of times, to account for changes in the DEM, in the S1 orbit, or in the static-layers generation algorithm.  Static layers are provided as single-band cloud-optimized GeoTIFF (COG) files, with map grid matching RTC-S1 products with the same burst ID.  The standard OPERA RTC-S1 product is derived from the original Copernicus Sentinel-1 (S1) interferometric wide (IW) single-look complex (SLC) data, provided by the European Space Agency, with a temporal sampling coincident with the availability of Sentinel-1A and Sentinel-1B SLC data. The OPERA RTC-S1-STATIC and RTC-S1 products are provided at a near global scope (land masses excluding Antarctica).  The RTC-S1 products are available in the associated OPERA Radiometric Terrain Corrected SAR Backscatter from Sentinel-1 validated product (Version 1) dataset.\nRead our doc on how to get AWS Credentials to retrieve this data: https://cumulus.asf.alaska.edu/s3credentialsREADME",

    "Name": "GPM IMERG Early Precipitation L3 1 day 0.1 degree x 0.1 degree V07 (GPM_3IMERGDE) at GES DISC",
    "Description": "Version 07 is the current version of the data set. Older versions will no longer be available and have been superseded by Version 07.\n\nThe Integrated Multi-satellitE Retrievals for GPM (IMERG) IMERG is a NASA product estimating global surface precipitation rates at a high resolution of 0.1° every half-hour beginning 2000.  It is part of the joint NASA-JAXA Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM) mission, using the GPM Core Observatory satellite as the standard to combine precipitation observations from an international constellation of satellites using advanced techniques.  IMERG can be used for global-scale applications as well as over regions with sparse or no reliable surface observations.  The fine spatial and temporal resolution of IMERG data allows them to be accumulated to the scale of the application for increased skill.  IMERG has three Runs with varying latencies in response to a range of application needs: rapid-response applications (Early Run, 4-h latency), same/next-day applications (Late Run, 14-h latency), and post-real-time research (Final Run, 3.5-month latency).  While IMERG strives for consistency and accuracy, satellite estimates of precipitation are expected to have lower skill over frozen surfaces, complex terrain, and coastal zones.  As well, the changing GPM satellite constellation over time may introduce artifacts that affect studies focusing on multi-year changes.\n\nThis dataset is the GPM Level 3 IMERG  *Early* Daily  10 x 10 km (GPM_3IMERGDE) derived from the half-hourly GPM_3IMERGHHE. The derived result represents an early (expedited) estimate of the daily mean precipitation rate in mm/day. The dataset is produced by first computing the mean precipitation rate in (mm/hour) in every grid cell, and then multiplying the result by 24.  This minimizes the possible dry bias in versions before \"07\", in the simple daily totals  for cells where less than 48 half-hourly observations are valid for the day. The latter under-sampling is very rare in the combined microwave-infrared (and rain gauge in the final) dataset, variable \"precipitation\",  and appears in higher latitudes. Thus, in most cases users of global \"precipitation\" data will not notice any difference. This correction, however, is noticeable in the high-quality microwave retrieval, variable \"MWprecipitation\", where the occurrence of less than 48 valid half-hourly samples per day is very common. The counts of the valid half-hourly samples per day have always been provided as a separate variable, and users of daily data were advised to pay close attention to that variable and use it to calculate the correct precipitation daily rates. Starting with version \"07\", this is done in production to minimize possible misinterpretations of the data. The counts are still provided in the data, but they are only given to gauge the significance of the daily rates, and reconstruct the simple totals if someone wishes to do so. \n\nThe latency of the derived Early daily product is a couple of minutes after the last granule of GPM_3IMERGHHE for the UTC data day is received at GES DISC. Since the target latency of GPM_3IMERGHHE is 4 hours, the daily should appear about 4 hours after the closure of the UTC day. For information on the original data (GPM_3IMERGHHE), please see the Documentation (Related URL). \n\nThe daily mean rate (mm/day) is derived by first computing the mean precipitation rate (mm/hour) in a grid cell for the data day, and then multiplying the result by 24.  Thus, for every grid cell we have                \n\nPdaily_mean     = SUM{Pi * 1[Pi valid]} / Pdaily_cnt  * 24, i=[1,Nf]\n\nWhere:\nPdaily_cnt = SUM{1[Pi valid]}\n\nPi              - half-hourly input, in (mm/hr)\nNf              - Number of half-hourly files per day, Nf=48\n1[.]            - Indicator function; 1 when Pi is valid, 0 otherwise\nPdaily_cnt      - Number of valid retrievals in a grid cell per day.\n\nGrid cells for which Pdaily_cnt=0, are set to fill value in the Daily files.\nNote that Pi=0 is a valid value.\n\nPdaily_cnt are provided in the data files as variables \"precipitation_cnt\" and \"MWprecipitation_cnt\", for correspondingly the microwave-IR-gauge and microwave-only retrievals. They are only given to gauge the significance of the daily rates, and reconstruct the simple totals if someone wishes to do so. \n\nThere are various ways the daily error could be estimated from the source half-hourly random error (variable \"randomError\"). The daily error provided in the data files is calculated in a fashion similar to the daily mean precipitation rate. First, the mean of the squared half-hourly \"randomError\"  for the day is computed, and the resulting (mm^2/hr) is converted to (mm^2/day). Finally, square root is taken to get the result in (mm/day):\n\nPerr_daily = { SUM{ (Perr_i)^2 * 1[Perr_i valid] ) } / Ncnt_err  * 24}^0.5, i=[1,Nf]\nNcnt_err   = SUM( 1[Perr_i valid] )\n\nwhere:\nPerr_i\t\t- half-hourly input, \"randomError\", (mm/hr)\nPerr_daily\t- Magnitude of the daily error, (mm/day)\nNcnt_err\t\t- Number of valid half-hour error estimates\n\nAgain, the sum of squared \"randomError\" can be reconstructed, and other estimates can be derived using the available counts in the Daily files.\n\n\nRead our doc on how to get AWS Credentials to retrieve this data: https://data.gesdisc.earthdata.nasa.gov/s3credentialsREADME",

    "Description": "The Rottnest Shelf (ROT) HF ocean radar system covers an area which includes Rottnest Island and the Perth Canyon to the north-west.  The Perth Canyon has the highest marine biodiversity in the region with whale and fish aggregations, and high primary and secondary productions which are controlled by the physical oceanographic processes.  \n\nCombined with the dynamics of the Perth Canyon is the dominant Leeuwin Current which produces a wake on the leeward side of Rottnest Island.   This is a topographically induced up-welling and associated primary and secondary productivity.  The region is influenced by Swan River outflow, submarine groundwater discharges , and waste-water outfalls.  \n\nThe ROT HF ocean radar is a WERA phased array system with 16-element receive arrays located at Fremantle (32.031 S, 115.746 E) and Guilderton (31.342 S, 115.489 E).  These radars operate at a frequency of 8.512 MHz, with a bandwidth of 33 KHz and a maximum range of 200 Km.  Within the HF radar coverage area surface currents are measured.  Data are also collected from which wind directions and significant wave height can be calculated.  \n\nThe ROT area of coverage has a small overlap of commonly observed ocean with the Turqoise Coast (TURQ) SeaSonde HF ocean radar system on its north side.  Together, the ROT and TURQ systems provide continuous monitoring of the shelf from Fremantle to Jurien Bay.",

We employed five different short and long-read sequencing technologies to generate phased assemblies and characterize both inherited and de novo variation, including at some of the most difficult to genotype genomic regions such as tandem repeats, centromeres, and the Y chromosome. This extensive \"truth set\" is publicly available and can be used to test and benchmark new algorithms and technologies to better understand human genetic variation.",

    "Description": "The Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) MCD43A3 Version 6.1 Albedo Model dataset is produced daily using 16 days of Terra and Aqua MODIS data at 500 meter (m) resolution. Data are temporally weighted to the ninth day of the 16 day which is reflected in the Julian date in the file name.\n\nUsers are urged to use the band specific quality flags to isolate the highest quality full inversion results for their own science applications as described in the [User Guide](https://www.umb.edu/spectralmass/modis-user-guide-v006-and-v0061/mcd43a3-albedo-product/).\n\nThe MCD43A3 provides black-sky albedo (directional hemispherical reflectance) and white-sky albedo (bihemispherical reflectance) data at local solar noon for MODIS bands 1 through 7 and the visible, near infrared (NIR), and shortwave bands. Along with the albedo layers are the simplified mandatory quality layers for each of the 10 bands. Essential quality information provided in the corresponding [MCD43A2](https://doi.org/10.5067/MODIS/MCD43A2.061) data file should be consulted when using this product.\n\nKnown Issues\n\n* For complete information about known issues please refer to the [MODIS/VIIRS Land Quality Assessment website](https://landweb.modaps.eosdis.nasa.gov/knownissue?sensor=MODIS&sat=TerraAqua&as=61).\n\nImprovements/Changes from Previous Versions\n\n* The Version 6.1 Level-1B (L1B) products have been improved by undergoing various calibration changes that include: changes to the response-versus-scan angle (RVS) approach that affects reflectance bands for Aqua and Terra MODIS, corrections to adjust for the optical crosstalk in Terra MODIS infrared (IR) bands, and corrections to the Terra MODIS forward look-up table (LUT) update for the period 2012 - 2017.\n* A polarization correction has been applied to the L1B Reflective Solar Bands (RSB).\nRead our doc on how to get AWS Credentials to retrieve this data: https://data.lpdaac.earthdatacloud.nasa.gov/s3credentialsREADME",

Met Office configurations are developed to be run using the community wave model WAVEWATCH IIITM. The global wave configuration is designed to generate accurate forecasts for open waters of the world’s oceans and larger seas. The Met Office wave models are forced using wind data from the Met Office Global Atmospheric Hi-Res Model. The global wave model is run to provide a five day outlook for wave characteristics defining height, period and direction of waves within a given sea-state. The model uses a refined grid system in order to better represent fetch in constrained sea areas and blocking effects of islands and headlands.

    "Description": "NASA's goal in Earth science is to observe, understand, and model the Earth system to discover how it is changing, to better predict change, and to understand the consequences for life on Earth. The Applied Sciences Program, within the Earth Science Division of the NASA Science Mission Directorate, serves individuals and organizations around the globe by expanding and accelerating societal and economic benefits derived from Earth science, information, and technology research and development.<br/><br/>\nThe [Prediction Of Worldwide Energy Resources (POWER)](https://power.larc.nasa.gov/) Project, funded through the Applied Sciences Program at NASA Langley Research Center, gathers NASA Earth observation data and parameters related to the fields of surface solar irradiance and meteorology to serve the public in several free, easy-to-access and easy-to-use methods. POWER helps communities become resilient amid observed climate variability by improving data accessibility, aiding research in energy development, building energy efficiency, and supporting agriculture projects.<br/><br/>\nThe POWER project contains over 380 satellite-derived meteorology and solar energy Analysis Ready Data (ARD) at four temporal levels: hourly, daily, monthly, and climatology. The POWER data archive provides data at the native resolution of the source products. The data is updated nightly to maintain near real time availability (2-3 days for meteorological parameters and 5-7 days for solar). The POWER services catalog consists of a series of RESTful Application Programming Interfaces, geospatial enabled image services, and web mapping Data Access Viewer. These three service offerings support data discovery, access, and distribution to the project’s user base as ARD and as direct application inputs to decision support tools.<br/><br/>\nThe latest data version update includes hourly-based source ARD, in addition to enhanced daily, monthly, annual, and climatology data. The daily time series for meteorology is available from 1981, while solar-based parameters start in 1984. The hourly source data are from Clouds and the Earth's Radiant Energy System (CERES) and Global Modeling and Assimilation Office (GMAO), spanning from 1984 for meteorology and from 2001 for solar-based parameters. The hourly data equips users with the ARD needed to model building system energy performance, providing information directly amenable to decision support tools introducing the industry standard EnergyPlus Weather file format.<br/><br/>\n",

    "Description": "The Aqua satellite platform carries a MODIS sensor that observes sunlight reflected from within the ocean surface layer at multiple wavelengths. These measurements at discrete wavelengths represent the spectrum of light leaving the water surface, and the shape of the spectrum is characteristic of the water optical properties.\n\nMoore et al. (2009) applied a clustering technique to spectra to identify 8 sets of discrete optical water types. This product \"owt_csiro\" is produced using a CSIRO implementation of the Moore et al. algorithm, and testing shows that it closely reproduces the results of the original Moore et al implementation in the NASA SeaDAS package.  The CSIRO implementation was created because the implementation in SeaDAS has not been kept up to date, and to extend the product to the VIIRS sensor.",

Positive NDVI anomaly values indicate vegetation is greener than average conditions, and are usually due to increased rainfall in a region. Negative values indicate additional plant stress relative to the long-term average. The NDVI anomaly service is therefore effective for understanding the extent, intensity and impact of a drought.Abrupt and significant negative anomalies may also be caused by fire disturbance.\n",

    "Description": "The Aqua satellite platform carries a MODIS sensor that observes sunlight reflected from within the ocean surface layer at multiple wavelengths. These multi-spectral measurements are used to infer the concentration of chlorophyll-a (Chl-a), most typically due to phytoplankton, present in the water. An empirical relationship is then used to compute an estimate of the relative abundance of three phytoplankton size classes (micro, nano and picoplankton). \n\nThe methods used to decompose chl_oc3 are described by Brewin et al in two papers in 2010 and 2012. The two methods, denoted Brewin2010at and Brewin2012in, used calibration data from the Atlantic and Indian Oceans respectively.  Users should note that these are unvalidated experimental products and they should familiarise themselves with the underlying algorithms and methodologies described in the published literature before making use of them.\n\nThe data are produced from the same data stream as the MODIS Chla_oci data set (https://catalogue-imos.aodn.org.au:443/geonetwork/srv/api/records/d7a14921-8f3f-4522-9a54-e7d1df969c8a). \n\nData are provided as two files per day, one with the percentage of nanoplankton, and one for picoplankton. The percentage of microplankton is computed as the balance to 100%, that is %micro = 100 - %nano - %pico.",

    "Description": "The 2010 Census Production Settings Demographic and Housing Characteristics (DHC) Approximate Monte Carlo (AMC) method seed Privacy Protected Microdata File (PPMF0) and PPMF replicates (PPMF1, PPMF2, ..., PPMF25) are a set of microdata files intended for use in estimating the magnitude of error(s) introduced by the 2020  Decennial Census Disclosure Avoidance System (DAS) into the Redistricting and DHC products. The PPMF0 was created by executing the 2020 DAS TopDown Algorithm (TDA) using the confidential  2010 Census Edited File (CEF) as the initial input; the replicates were then created by executing the 2020 DAS TDA repeatedly with the PPMF0 as its initial input.  Inspired by analogy to the use of bootstrap methods in non-private contexts, U.S. Census Bureau (USCB) researchers explored whether simple calculations  based on comparing each PPMFi to the PPMF0 could be used to reliably estimate the scale of errors introduced by the 2020 DAS, and generally found this approach  worked well. <br/> <br/> The PPMF0 and PPMFi files contained here are provided so that external researchers can estimate properties of DAS-introduced error without privileged  access to internal USCB-curated data sets; further information on the estimation methodology can be found in [Ashmead et. al 2024](https://github.com/uscensusbureau/AMC_Confidence_Intervals/blob/main/Approx_Monte_Carlo_confidence_interval_paper.pdf).  <br/> <br/> The 2010 DHC AMC seed PPMF0 and PPMF replicates have been cleared for public dissemination by the USCB Disclosure Review Board (CBDRB-FY24-DSEP-0002).  The 2010 PPMF0 included in these files was produced using the same parameters and settings as were used to produce the 2010 Demonstration Data Product  Suite (2023-04-03) PPMF, but represents an independent execution of the TopDown Algorithm. The PPMF0 and PPMF replicates contain all Person and Units attributes necessary to produce the Redistricting and DHC publications for both the United States and  Puerto Rico, and include geographic detail down to the Census Block level. They do not include attributes specific to either the Detailed DHC-A or Detailed DHC-B  products; in particular, data on Major Race (e.g., White Alone) is included, but data on Detailed Race (e.g., Cambodian) is not included in the PPMF0 and replicates. <br/> <br/> The [2020 AMC replicate files](https://registry.opendata.aws/census-2020-amc-mdf-replicates/) for estimating confidence intervals for the official 2020 Census statistics are available.  \n ",

EDDE is a collection of physics-based modeled data that represent 3D atmospheric conditions for historical and future periods under different scenarios. The EDDE Version 2 datasets cover the contiguous United States at a horizontal grid spacing of 12 kilometers at hourly increments. EDDE Version 2 will include simulations that have been dynamically downscaled from multiple global climate models (GCMs) under multiple emission scenarios from the Sixth Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP6) using the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model. Scenarios were downscaled from the  Max Planck Institute (MPI) Earth System Model (ESM) version 1.2 High Resolution  (MPI-ESM1-2-HR), with plans to expand into additional GCMs in the future.  Simulations cover the historical period 1985-2014 and a future period of  2025-2100 under Shared Socioeconomic Pathway (SSP) 3-7.0. Data are in Network Common Data Form (netCDF) version 4, which is used in atmospheric modeling. The EDDE data in netCDF are further written to adhere to principles of Climate and Forecasting System (CF) Compliance to enhance portability and interoperability with data from other sources.

These multi-spectral measurements are used to infer the diffuse attenuation coefficient (Kd) at 490nm wavelength which provides information on how light is attenuated in the water column. It is defined as the scaling length of the exponential decrease of the downwelling irradiance and has units (m^-1). The MODIS K490 product estimates Kd at 490nm wavelength, using a semi-empirical model based on the ratio of water leaving radiances at 490nm and 555nm. The algorithm is described at https://oceancolor.gsfc.nasa.gov/atbd/kd/.",

    "Description": "The Atmospheric Infrared Sounder (AIRS) is a grating spectrometer (R = 1200) aboard the second Earth Observing System (EOS) polar-orbiting platform, EOS Aqua. In combination with the Advanced Microwave Sounding Unit (AMSU) and the Humidity Sounder for Brazil (HSB), AIRS constitutes an innovative atmospheric sounding group of visible, infrared, and microwave sensors. The AIRS Infrared (IR) level 1C data set contains AIRS infrared calibrated and geolocated radiances in W/m2/micron/ster. This data set is generated from AIRS level 1B data. The spectral coverage of L1C data is from 3.74 to 15.4 mm. The nominal spectral resolution lambda / delta lambda = 1200. The spectrum is sampled twice per spectral resolution element in a total of 2645 spectral channels. A day of AIRS data is divided into 240 granules (scenes) each of 6-minute duration. For the AIRS IR measurements, an individual granule contains 135 pixels across-track and 90 along-track pixels; there are total of 135 x 90 = 12,150 pixels per granule. AIRS employs a 49.5 degree crosstrack scanning with a 1.1 degree instantaneous field of view (IFOV) to provide twice daily coverage of essentially the entire globe in a 1:30 PM sun synchronous orbit with the 13.5 x 13.5 km2 spatial resolution at nadir. The L1C swath products are derived from the L1B swath products. The primary purpose of the level 1C is to generate the spectra of radiances without spectral gaps caused by the instrument design and bad spectral points. The AIRS L1C data can be used for comparative (with other IR measurements) studies and for weather-climate research.\n\nThis is the latest version of this collection.

This collection of data contains surface water currents forecast guidance from [NOAA/NOS Operational Forecast Systems](https://tidesandcurrents.noaa.gov/models.html), a set of operational hydrodynamic nowcast and forecast modeling systems, for various U.S. coastal waters and the great lakes. The collection also contains surface current forecast guidance output from the [NCEP Global Real-Time Ocean Forecast System (GRTOFS)](https://polar.ncep.noaa.gov/global/) for some offshore areas. These datasets are encoded as HDF-5 files conforming to the S-111 specification, and are geospatially subset into individual tiles conforming to the NOAA/OCS Nautical Product Tiling Scheme, with filenames indicating the corresponding NOAA Electronic Navigational Chart (ENC) Cell Identifier.\nA full set of S-111 tiles is created for each new model run cycle, which occurs four times per day for all models except for RTOFS, which updates only once per day. Files are organized using a path naming convention that includes the OFS identifier (e.g. 'cbofs' corresponding with output from the Chesapeake Bay Operational Forecast System) as well as the year, month, day, and hour corresponding with each model run initialization time. Each individual S-111 (HDF-5) file contains all forecast projections from a single model run for that geographic area. In other words, a single S-111 file will contain multiple gridded arrays each containing a forecast valid at a distinct time in the future, out to the forecast horizon of the underlying modeling system. All surface currents forecasts in this collection are computed at a depth of 4.5 meters below water surface, or half the water column depth, whichever is shallower.\n",

    "Description": "The Terra Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Vegetation Indices (MOD13Q1) Version 6.1 data are generated every 16 days at 250 meter (m) spatial resolution as a Level 3 product. The MOD13Q1 product provides two primary vegetation layers. The first is the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) which is referred to as the continuity index to the existing National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration-Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (NOAA-AVHRR) derived NDVI. The second vegetation layer is the Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI), which has improved sensitivity over high biomass regions. The algorithm chooses the best available pixel value from all the acquisitions from the 16 day period. The criteria used is low clouds, low view angle, and the highest NDVI/EVI value.\n\nAlong with the vegetation layers and the two quality layers, the HDF file will have MODIS reflectance bands 1 (red), 2 (near-infrared), 3 (blue), and 7 (mid-infrared), as well as four observation layers. \n\nKnown Issues\n* For complete information about known issues please refer to the [MODIS/VIIRS Land Quality Assessment website](https://landweb.modaps.eosdis.nasa.gov/knownissue?sensor=MODIS&sat=Terra&as=61).\n\nImprovements/Changes from Previous Versions\n* The Version 6.1 Level-1B (L1B) products have been improved by undergoing various calibration changes that include: changes to the response-versus-scan angle (RVS) approach that affects reflectance bands for Aqua and Terra MODIS, corrections to adjust for the optical crosstalk in Terra MODIS infrared (IR) bands, and corrections to the Terra MODIS forward look-up table (LUT) update for the period 2012 - 2017.\n* A polarization correction has been applied to the L1B Reflective Solar Bands (RSB).\nRead our doc on how to get AWS Credentials to retrieve this data: https://data.lpdaac.earthdatacloud.nasa.gov/s3credentialsREADME",

    "Description": "\nNOTICE - The Coast Survey Development Laboratory (CSDL) in NOAA/National Ocean Service (NOS)/Office of Coast Survey is upgrading the Surge and Tide Operational Forecast System (STOFS, formerly ESTOFS) to Version 2.1. A Service Change Notice (SCN) has been issued and can be found \"[HERE](https://www.weather.gov/media/notification/pdf_2023_24/scn23-124_stofs_upgrade_v2.1.4_aaf.pdf)\"<br /><br />\n\n NOAA's Surge and Tide Operational Forecast System: Three-Dimensional Component for the Atlantic Basin (STOFS-3D-Atlantic). STOFS-3D-Atlantic runs daily (at 12 UTC)  to provide users with 24-hour nowcasts (analyses of near present conditions) and up to 96-hour forecast guidance of water level conditions, and 2- and 3-dimensional fields of water temperature, salinity, and currents. The water level outputs represent the combined tidal and subtidal water surface elevations and are referenced to xGEOID20B <br /><br />\n STOFS-3D-Atlantic has been developed to serve the marine navigation, weather forecasting, and disaster mitigation user communities. It is developed in a collaborative effort between the NOAA/National Ocean Service (NOS)/Office of Coast Survey, the NOAA/National Weather Service (NWS)/National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) Central Operations (NCO), and the Virginia Institute of Marine Science. <br /><br />\n \n STOFS-3D-Atlantic employs the Semi-implicit Cross-scale Hydroscience Integrated System Model (SCHISM) as the hydrodynamic model core. Its unstructured grid consists of 2,926,236 nodes and 5,654,157 triangular or quadrilateral elements. Grid resolution is 1.5-2 km near the shoreline, ~600 m for the floodplain, down to 8 m for watershed rivers (at least 3 nodes across each river cross-section), and around 2-10 m for levees. Along the U.S. coastline, the land boundary of the domain aligns with the 10-m contour above xGEOID20B, encompassing the coastal transitional zone most vulnerable to coastal and inland flooding. <br /> <br />\n \n STOFS-3D-Atlantic makes uses of outputs from the National Water Model (NWM) to include inland hydrology and extreme precipitation effects on coastal flooding; forecast guidance from the NCEP Global Forecast System (GFS) and High-Resolution Rapid Refresh (HRRR) model as the surface meteorological forcing; the tidal water level and currents from the FES2014 tidal database; and the subtidal water level, and subtidal three-dimensional water temperature, salinity, and currents from the NCEP Global Real-Time Ocean Forecast System (G-RTOFS) with the subtidal water level from G-RTOFS and Copernicus Absolute Dynamic Topography (ADT) satellite altimetry observation as the open ocean boundary forcing. <br /> <br />\n \n STOFS-3D-Atlantic forecast guidance output available here include NetCDF, GRIB2, SHEF, and GPKG files.

The version 4 Multiscale Ultrahigh Resolution (MUR) L4 analysis is based upon nighttime GHRSST L2P skin and subskin SST observations from several instruments including the NASA Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer-EOS (AMSR-E), the JAXA Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer 2 on GCOM-W1, the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometers (MODIS) on the NASA Aqua and Terra platforms, the US Navy microwave WindSat radiometer, the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) on several NOAA satellites, and in situ SST observations from the NOAA iQuam project. The ice concentration data are from the archives at the EUMETSAT Ocean and Sea Ice Satellite Application Facility (OSI SAF) High Latitude Processing Center and are also used for an improved SST parameterization for the high-latitudes.  The dataset also contains additional variables for some granules including a SST anomaly derived from a MUR climatology and the temporal distance to the nearest IR measurement for each pixel.This dataset is funded by the NASA MEaSUREs program ( http://earthdata.nasa.gov/our-community/community-data-system-programs/measures-projects ), and created by a team led by Dr. Toshio M. Chin from JPL. It adheres to the GHRSST Data Processing Specification (GDS) version 2 format specifications. Use the file global metadata \"history:\" attribute to determine if a granule is near-realtime or retrospective.\nRead our doc on how to get AWS Credentials to retrieve this data: https://archive.podaac.earthdata.nasa.gov/s3credentialsREADME",

    "Description": "This dataset is a modification to the Integrated Multi-satellitE Retrievals for GPM (IMERG) Final Run microwave-only, daily precipitation Version 06 data. It provides bias-corrected IMERG monthly precipitation data for Alaska and Canada from June 2000 through December 2020 in Cloud-Optimized GeoTIFF (*.tif) format. Data are provided in the units of mm/day. NASA's IMERG data product is one of the most advanced satellite precipitation products with a 0.1-degree spatial resolution and near global coverage. This dataset bias-corrected IMERG's HQprecipitation precipitation estimates, which are based on passive microwave (PMW)-only retrievals, using a linear regression method. This method utilizes empirical measurements from rain gauge stations from the Global Historical Climatology Network (GHCN) and a digital elevation model. This bias correction approach improves estimates at elevations above 500 m a.s.l., which are typically underestimated.\nRead our doc on how to get AWS Credentials to retrieve this data: https://data.ornldaac.earthdata.nasa.gov/s3credentialsREADME",

    "Description": "The NIH Common Fund's Gabriella Miller Kids First Pediatric Research Program’s (“Kids First”) vision is to “alleviate suffering from childhood cancer and structural birth defects by fostering collaborative research to uncover the etiology of these diseases and by supporting data sharing within the pediatric research community.” The program continues to generate and share whole genome sequence data from thousands of children affected by these conditions, ranging from rare pediatric cancers, such as osteosarcoma, to more prevalent diagnoses, such as congenital heart defects. In 2018, Kids First launched the Gabriella Miller Kids First Data Resource Center, charged with building a large-scale data platform supporting clinical and genetic data from these patients and their families in order to accelerate discovery and ultimately clinical impact. Researchers can search, access, aggregate, and analyze these data through the Kids First Data Resource Portal. Additionally, by using cloud-based individual workspaces in CAVATICA, a data analysis and sharing computation platform, researchers can cross-analyze Kids First data with data from other efforts, such as NCI’s TARGET program and consortia-based datasets like the Children’s Brain Tumor Tissue Consortium (CBTTC).\nKids First is made available on AWS via the [NIH STRIDES Initiative](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/publicsector/aws-and-national-institutes-of-health-collaborate-to-accelerate-discoveries-with-strides-initiative/).\n",

    "Description": "Africa's long and dynamic coastline is subject to a wide range of pressures, including extreme weather and climate, sea level rise and human development. Understanding how the coastline responds to these pressures is crucial to managing this region, from social, environmental and economic perspectives.\nThe Digital Earth Africa Coastlines (provisional) is a continental dataset that includes annual shorelines and rates of coastal change along the entire African coastline from 2000 to the present.\nThe product combines satellite data from the Digital Earth Africa program with tidal modelling to map the typical location of the coastline at mean sea level for each year. The product enables trends of coastal erosion and growth to be examined annually at both a local and continental scale, and for patterns of coastal change to be mapped historically and updated regularly as data continues to be acquired. This allows current rates of coastal change to be compared with that observed in previous years or decades.\nThe ability to map shoreline positions for each year provides valuable insights into whether changes to the coastline are the result of particular events or actions, or a process of more gradual change over time. This information can enable scientists, managers and policy makers to assess impacts from the range of drivers impacting the coastlines and potentially assist planning and forecasting for future scenarios.\n",

GRAF is global, but the configuration for this reforecast had a mesh refinement to approx. 4 km over the US, Caribbean Basin, and Europe, and 15 km elsewhere. This model was designed to run much of its computation on graphical processing units, with this development assisted by NVIDIA. The 1836 cases (approx. 5 years) were generated from ECMWF reanalyses (ERA5) for initial condition dates spanning more than 20 years, 2004-2024. These dates of the chosen initial conditions mostly selected based on high-impact weather in the contiguous US (CONUS) and Caribbean. Sampling in this way spanned a wider range of interesting, high-impact weather scenarios than were there five contiguous years of data. GRAF reforecasts were mostly run to +27 h lead time, assuming a 3-h for spin up followed by a full diurnal cycle. Data were saved in zarr format on the native model vertical coordinate. Most fields were saved at 15-min intervals, though several precipitation variables were saved at 5-min cadence.",

    "Description": "Released to the public as part of the Department of Energy's Open Energy Data Initiative, \nthese data represent a serially complete collection of hourly 4km wind, solar, temperature, \nhumidity, and pressure fields for the Continental United States under climate change scenarios.\n\nSup3rCC is downscaled Global Climate Model (GCM) data. For example, the initial file set tagged\n\"sup3rcc_conus_mriesm20_ssp585_r1i1p1f1\" is downscaled from MRI ESM 2.0 for climate change \nscenario SSP5 8.5 and variant label r1i1p1f1. The downscaling process is performed using a \ngenerative machine learning approach called sup3r: Super-Resolution for Renewable Energy \nResource Data. The data includes both historical and future weather years, although the \nhistorical years represent the historical average climate, not true historical weather. \n\nThe Sup3rCC data is intended to help researchers study the impact of climate change on energy \nsystems with high levels of wind and solar power generation. Please note that all climate change \ndata is only a representation of the *possible* future climate and contains significant \nuncertainty. Analysis of multiple climate change scenarios and multiple climate models can help \nquantify this uncertainty.\n",

    "Description": "The Observational Products for End-Users from Remote Sensing Analysis (OPERA) Radiometric Terrain Corrected (RTC) SAR Backscatter from Sentinel-1 (S1) validated product consists of radar backscatter normalized with respect to the topography. The product maps signals related to the physical properties of ground scattering objects, such as surface roughness and soil moisture and/or vegetation. The OPERA RTC-S1 product is derived from Copernicus Sentinel-1 Interferometric Wide (IW) Single Look Complex (SLC) data with a near global scope and temporal sampling coincident with the availability of S1 SLC data. \n\nEach OPERA RTC-S1 product corresponds to a single S1 burst projected onto a pre-defined UTM/Polar stereographic map projection system map grid with a 30-meter spacing. The Copernicus global 30 m (GLO-30) Digital Elevation Model (DEM) is the reference DEM used to correct for the impacts of topography and to geocode the product.  The OPERA RTC-S1 product is normalized to the backscatter coefficient gamma-naught, ɣ0,  obtained from the original radar brightness beta-naught, β0,  through radiometric terrain correction.  The RTC-S1 product is distributed as cloud optimized GeoTIFFs with one GeoTIFF file per processed polarization. The RTC-S1 product metadata is provided in the Hierarchical Data Format version 5 (HDF5) format. The OPERA RTC-S1 product contains modified Copernicus Sentinel data (2022-2025).\n\nDue to the S1 mission’s narrow orbital tube, radar-geometry layers such as incidence angle, local incidence angle, number of looks, and RTC Area Normalization Factor (ANF) vary slightly over time for each position on the ground, and therefore are considered static. These static layers are provided separately from the OPERA RTC-S1 product, as they are produced only once or a limited number of times, to account for changes in the DEM, in the S1 orbit, or in the static-layers generation algorithm. The static layers are available in the associated OPERA Radiometric Terrain Corrected SAR Backscatter from Sentinel-1 Static Layers validated product (Version 1) dataset.\nRead our doc on how to get AWS Credentials to retrieve this data: https://cumulus.asf.alaska.edu/s3credentialsREADME",

    "Description": "The Copernicus Global Land Service – Lake Water Quality products offer a comprehensive, satellite-derived monitoring system for assessing key water quality indicators in major large lakes, typically those greater than 50 hectares. These datasets are generated using optical satellite sensors, primarily Sentinel-2 MSI and Sentinel-3 OLCI, with earlier archives derived from Envisat MERIS. Spanning multiple spatial resolutions (100 m and 300 m) and temporal scales (10-day composites), they support both near-real-time and retrospective assessments of inland water quality.\n\nKey parameters include surface reflectance, turbidity, total suspended matter (TSM), chlorophyll-a concentration, trophic state index, and floating cyanobacteria risk—all essential for monitoring eutrophication, ecological health, and harmful algal blooms (HABs). The datasets cover the period from 2002 to the present, providing long-term continuity for environmental monitoring and scientific research, with focused coverage in Europe and Africa.\n\nAll products are delivered using standardized geospatial grids (EPSG:4326) and include quality flags, detailed metadata, and validation against in situ observations to ensure reliability. Continuous improvements across product versions—such as enhanced atmospheric correction and updated retrieval algorithms—have significantly improved accuracy and usability. In addition, comprehensive user manuals, technical documentation, and support materials are available, making the data highly accessible to researchers, policymakers, and environmental managers.\n\nDigital Earth Africa (DE Africa) hosts these datasets for the African region, providing free and open access to both the data and associated tools.\n",

These data products are designed to facilitate a broad variety of research using the NCAR CESM 2.1 (National Center for Atmospheric Research's Community Earth System Model version 2.1), including model evaluation, ensemble hindcasting, data assimilation experiments, and sensitivity studies. They come from an 80 member ensemble reanalysis of the global troposphere and stratosphere using DART and CAM6. The data products represent states of the atmosphere consistent with observations from 2011 through 2019 at 1 degree horizontal resolution and weekly frequency. Each ensemble member is an equally likely description of the atmosphere, and is also consistent with dynamics and physics of CAM6. The dataset also contains corresponding land surface values at 6-hourly frequency.  This dataset is a reformatting, with no change to numerical values, of data from the \"CAM6 Data Assimilation Research Testbed (DART) Reanalysis\", [DOI:10.5065/JG1E-8525](https://doi.org/10.5065/JG1E-8525).\n",

It is a collection of three-dimensional (3D) atomic-level structures of biological macromolecules (i.e., proteins, DNA, and RNA) and their complexes with one another and various small-molecule ligands (e.g., US FDA approved drugs, enzyme co-factors). For each PDB entry (unique identifier: 1abc or PDB_0000001abc) multiple data files contain information about the 3D atomic coordinates, sequences of biological macromolecules, information about any small molecules/ligands present in the entry, details about the structure-determination experiment, authors and publication information, experimental data, and the wwPDB validation report. Additional content stored in the archive includes documentation, summary reports, and software (among others).\nThe PDB is a jointly-managed core archive of the Worldwide Protein Data Bank partnership [RCSB Protein Data Bank (RCSB PDB, rcsb.org); Protein Data Bank in Europe (PDBe, pdbe.org); Protein Data Bank Japan (PDBj, pdbj.org); Electron Microscopy Data Bank (EMDB, emdb-empiar.org); and Biological Magnetic Resonance Bank (BMRB, bmrb.io)].\nRCSB PDB serves as the wwPDB-designated Archive Keeper for the Protein Data Bank.\nAdditional wwPDB Core Archives are as follows:\nElectron Microscopy Data Bank (wwPDB-designated Archive Keeper: EMDB)\nBiological Magnetic Resonance Bank (wwPDB-designated Archive Keeper: BMRB)\n",

The Sentinel-1 mission, part of the Copernicus joint initiative by the European Commission (EC) and the European Space Agency (ESA), provides reliable and repeated wide-area monitoring using its SAR instrument.Sentinel-1 Monthly Mosaics are analysis-ready product of individual Sentinel-1 acquisitions. Sentinel-1 monthly mosaics are generated from Radiometric Terrain Corrected (RTC) backscatter data, with variations from changing observation geometries mitigated. RTC images acquired within a calendar month are combined using a multitemporal compositing algorithm. This algorithm calculates a weighted average of valid pixels, assigning higher weights to pixels with higher local resolution (e.g., slopes facing away from the sensor). This local resolution weighting approach minimizes noise and improves spatial homogeneity in the composites. Sinergise (Planet Labs) processed and indexed the product on the DE Africa platform\n",

    "Description": "GeoMAD is the Digital Earth Africa (DE Africa) surface reflectance geomedian and triple Median Absolute Deviation data service. It is a cloud-free composite of satellite data compiled over specific timeframes.\nThe geomedian component combines measurements collected over the specified timeframe to produce one representative, multispectral measurement for every pixel unit of the African continent. The end result is a comprehensive dataset that can be used to generate true-colour images for visual inspection of anthropogenic or natural landmarks. The full spectral dataset can be used to develop more complex algorithms.\nFor each pixel, invalid data is discarded, and remaining observations are mathematically summarised using the geomedian statistic. Flyover coverage provided by collecting data over a period of time also helps scope intermittently cloudy areas.\nVariations between the geomedian and the individual measurements are captured by the three Median Absolute Deviation (MAD) layers. These are higher-order statistical measurements calculating variation relative to the geomedian. The MAD layers can be used on their own or together with geomedian to gain insights about the land surface, and understand change over time.\nCalculating GeoMAD over different timeframes and sensors provides a range of insights to the environment. An annual timeframe allows better correction for cloud cover and reduces artifacts for comparison over multiple years. A semiannual timeframe, for example six-month blocks, better captures seasonal variation within one year, but can also be used to compare equivalent periods from different years. Likewise, Landsat sensors allows full utility of the surface reflectance archive dating back to 1984, while more recent Sentinel-2 data provides higher-frequency flyovers and better resolution.\nThe Digital Earth Africa GeoMAD service currently provides annual and six-month semiannual datasets, with separate services for Landsat and Sentinel-2 sensors.\n",

The MMRF’s vision is to track the treatment and results for each\nCoMMpass patient so that someday the information can be used to guide decisions for newly\ndiagnosed patients. CoMMpass checked on patients every 6 months for 8 years, collecting tissue\nsamples, genetic, information, quality of life and various disease and clinical outcomes.

ClinVar thus facilitates access to and communication about the relationships asserted between human variation and observed health status, and the history of that interpretation. ClinVar processes submissions reporting variants found in patient samples, assertions made regarding their clinical significance, information about the submitter, and other supporting data. The alleles described in submissions are mapped to reference sequences, and reported according to the HGVS standard. ClinVar then presents the data for interactive users as well as those wishing to use ClinVar in daily workflows and other local applications. ClinVar works in collaboration with interested organizations to meet the needs of the medical genetics community as efficiently and effectively as possible. This representation of ClinVar is stored in Parquet format and most easily utilized through Amazon Athena. Follow the documentation link for install instructions (< 2 minute install).",

Buoy data from the following organisations contribute to the National Wave Archive: Manly Hydraulics Laboratory (part of the NSW Department of Planning and Environment (DPE), which has assumed function of the former NSW Office of Environment and Heritage (OEH)); Bureau of Meteorology; Western Australia Department of Transport (DOT); the Queensland Department of Environment and Science (DES); the Integrated Marine Observing System (IMOS); Gippsland Ports; the NSW Nearshore Wave Data Program from the NSW Department of Planning and Environment (DPE); the University of Western Australia (UWA); Deakin University, Pilbara Ports Authority and Flinders University and South Australian Research and Development Institute (SARDI). \n\nThe data from MHL, BOM, DOT, DES, Gippsland Ports and Pilbara Ports Authority, is gathered by the Waverider system developed by the Dutch company, Datawell. Some older wave data were collected using non-directional Waverider buoys. As technology advanced and directional measuring capabilities were developed in wave buoys, wave buoy networks were gradually upgraded to directional Waverider buoys. Therefore, some older datasets do not have directional information whereas newer datasets have directional information.\n\nThe data from IMOS, the NSW Nearshore Wave Data Program, DPE, UWA, Deakin, Flinders University and SARDI comes from Spotter Wave Buoys, developed by Sofar Ocean Technologies, which collect data similarly to the Waverider system.\n\nBOM, DES, DOT, MHL, IMOS (some) and Gippsland Ports - The wave buoy data is issued in GTS bulletins (which are only available for 24 hours) : IOWK01 (in BUFR format) and SWWE01 (CREX format). The data is collated by the Bureau into a CSV file (containing the last 24 hours of observations) which is updated every hour, at 5 minutes past the hour. This data is provided via WFS to the AODN.\nNote - The Maria Island buoy is currently undergoing repairs, so data is unavailable, we will update when resolved (May 2024).\n\nIMOS (some), DPE, UWA, Deakin, Flinders University + SARDI - The data is updated every hour, at 40 minutes past the hour.\n\nPilbara Ports Authority - The data is uploaded every hour, at 30 minutes past the hour.",

    "Description": "This dataset contains Global Ecosystem Dynamics Investigation (GEDI) Level 4A (L4A) Version 2 predictions of the aboveground biomass density (AGBD; in Mg/ha) and estimates of the prediction standard error within each sampled geolocated laser footprint. In this version, the granules are in sub-orbits. The algorithm setting group selection used for GEDI02_A Version 2 has been modified for Evergreen Broadleaf Trees in South America to reduce false positive errors resulting from the selection of waveform modes above ground elevation as the lowest mode. The footprints are located within the global latitude band observed by the International Space Station (ISS), nominally 51.6 degrees N and S and reported for the period 2019-04-18 to 2024-11-27. No acquisitions occurred while the GEDI instrument was in storage on the International Space Station (ISS) from March 2023 to April 2024. The GEDI instrument consists of three lasers producing a total of eight beam ground transects, which instantaneously sample eight ~25 m footprints spaced approximately every 60 m along-track. The GEDI beam transects are spaced approximately 600 m apart on the Earth's surface in the cross-track direction, for an across-track width of ~4.2 km. Footprint AGBD was derived from parametric models that relate simulated GEDI Level 2A (L2A) waveform relative height (RH) metrics to field plot estimates of AGBD. Height metrics from simulated waveforms associated with field estimates of AGBD from multiple regions and plant functional types (PFTs) were compiled to generate a calibration dataset for models representing the combinations of world regions and PFTs (i.e., deciduous broadleaf trees, evergreen broadleaf trees, evergreen needleleaf trees, deciduous needleleaf trees, and the combination of grasslands, shrubs, and woodlands). For each of the eight beams, additional data are reported with the AGBD estimates, including the associated uncertainty metrics, quality flags, model inputs, and other information about the GEDI L2A waveform for this selected algorithm setting group. Model inputs include the scaled and transformed GEDI L2A RH metrics, footprint geolocation variables and land cover input data including PFTs and the world region identifiers. Additional model outputs include the AGBD predictions for each of the six GEDI L2A algorithm setting groups with AGBD in natural and transformed units and associated prediction uncertainty for each GEDI L2A algorithm setting group. Providing these ancillary data products will allow users to evaluate and select alternative algorithm setting groups. Also provided are outputs of parameters and variables from the L4A models used to generate AGBD predictions that are required as input to the GEDI04_B algorithm to generate 1-km gridded products.\nRead our doc on how to get AWS Credentials to retrieve this data: https://data.ornldaac.earthdata.nasa.gov/s3credentialsREADME",

Multi-modal sensor data has been collected from fully autonomous Indy race cars operating at speeds of up to 170 mph (273 kph). Six teams who raced in the Indy Autonomous Challenge during 2021-22 have contributed to this dataset. The dataset spans 11 interesting racing scenarios across two race tracks which include solo laps, multi-agent laps, overtaking situations, high-accelerations, banked tracks, obstacle avoidance, pit entry and exit at different speeds. The data is organized and released in both ROS2 and nuScenes format. We have also developed the ROS2-to-nuScenes conversion library to achieve this. The RACECAR data is unique because of the high-speed environment of autonomous racing and is suitable to explore issues regarding localization, object detection and tracking (LiDAR, Radar, and Camera), and mapping that arise at the limits of operation of the autonomous vehicle.",

    "Name": "NOAA National Air Quality Forecast Capability (NAQFC) Regional Model Guidance",
    "Description": "The National Air Quality Forecasting Capability (NAQFC) dataset contains model-generated air quality (AQ) forecast guidance from three different prediction systems. The first system is a coupled weather and atmospheric chemistry numerical forecast model, known as the Air Quality Model (AQM). It is used to produce forecast guidance for ozone (O3) and particulate matter that is less than or equal to 2.5 micrometers in diameter (PM2.5). Prior to May 14, 2024, AQM predictions were derived using the EPA’s Community Multiscale Air Quality (CMAQ) model, driven by meteorological fields from NCEP’s operational weather forecast models, specifically the North American Mesoscale Model (NAM; prior to 20 July 2021) and the Global Forecast System (GFS; beginning 20 July 2021). Since May 14, 2024, AQM guidance has been produced by a unique application within the community-based Unified Forecast System (UFS). The core model components in this application are derived directly from the fully online-coupled UFS-based weather and CMAQ-based chemistry models. In addition, it incorporates information related to chemical and particle source emissions as it integrates forward in time, including anthropogenic chemical emissions provided by the EPA, fire emissions from NOAA/NESDIS, and airborne particles generated by human activities and those predicted to be generated by wind-driven erosion and biosphere at ground level. The NCEP NAQFC AQM output fields in this archive include model raw and bias-corrected predictions dating back to 1 January 2020, all generated by the contemporaneous operational AQM, beginning with AQMv5 in 2020, transitioning to AQMv6 on 20 July 2021, and to AQMv7 on 14 May 2024. The length of each forecast was 48 hours prior to the implementation of AQMv6, and has been 72 hours ever since. The history of AQM upgrades is documented [here](https://www.emc.ncep.noaa.gov/mmb/aq/AQChangelog.html)\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThe second prediction is known as the Hybrid Single-Particle Lagrangian Integrated Trajectory model (HYSPLIT). It is a widely used atmospheric transport and dispersion model containing an internal dust-generation module. It provides forecast guidance for atmospheric dust concentration and, prior to 28 June 2022, it also provided the NAQFC forecast guidance for smoke. Starting on that date, the third prediction system, a regional numerical weather prediction (NWP) model known as the Rapid Refresh (RAP) model, subsumed HYSPLIT for operational smoke guidance, simulating the emission, transport, and deposition of smoke particles that originate from biomass burning (fires) and anthropogenic sources.\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThe output from each of these modeling systems is generated over three separate domains, one covering CONUS, another over Alaska, and the other over Hawaii. Currently, for this archive, the O3, PM2.5, and smoke output is available over all three domains, while dust products are available only over the CONUS domain. The predicted concentrations of all species in the lowest model layer (i.e., the layer in contact with the surface) are available, as are vertically integrated values of smoke and dust. The data is gridded horizontally within each domain, with a grid spacing of approximately 5 km over CONUS, 6 km over Alaska, and 2.5 km over Hawaii. O3 concentrations are provided in parts per billion (PPB), while the concentrations of all other species are quantified in units of micrograms per cubic meter (ug/m3), except for the column-integrated smoke values which are expressed in units of milligrams per square meter (mg/m2).\n<br/>\n<br/>\nTemporally, O3 and PM2.5 are available as maximum and/or averaged values over various time periods, selected in part for consistency with the EPA’s National Ambient Air Quality Standards. Specifically, O3 is available in both 1-hour and 8-hour (backward calculated) averages, as well as preceding 1-hour and 8-hour maximum values. Similarly, PM2.5 is available in 1-hour and 24-hour average values and 24-hour maximum values. In addition, all O3 and PM2.5 fields are available with bias-corrected magnitudes, based on derived historical model biases relative to observations.\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThe AQM produces hourly forecast guidance for O3 and PM2.5 up to 72 hours twice per day. Smoke guidance is available up to 51 hours from once-per-day RAP forecasts, while dust guidance from HYSPLIT is available up to 48 hours.\n",

    "Description": "The European Space Agency (ESA) WorldCover product provides global land cover maps for 2020 & 2021 at 10 m resolution based on Copernicus Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 data. The WorldCover product comes with 11 land cover classes and has been generated in the framework of the ESA WorldCover project, part of the 5th Earth Observation Envelope Programme (EOEP-5) of the European Space Agency. A first version of the product (v100), containing the 2020 map was released in October 2021. The 2021 map was released in October 2022 using an improved algorithm (v200). The WorldCover 2020 and 2021 maps were generated with different algorithm versions and therefore changes between the maps should be treated with caution as these contain both real land cover changes as well as changes due to the used algorithms.",

    "Description": "With recent advances in machine learning, semantic segmentation algorithms are becoming increasingly general purpose and translatable to unseen tasks. Many key algorithmic advances in the field of medical imaging are commonly validated on a small number of tasks, limiting our understanding of the generalisability of the proposed contributions. A model which works out-of-the-box on many tasks, in the spirit of AutoML, would have a tremendous impact on healthcare. The field of medical imaging is also missing a fully open source and comprehensive benchmark for general purpose algorithmic validation and testing covering a large span of challenges, such as: small data, unbalanced labels, large-ranging object scales, multi-class labels, and multimodal imaging, etc. This challenge and dataset aims to provide such resource through the open sourcing of large medical imaging datasets on several highly different tasks, and by standardising the analysis and validation process.",

The MRKR dataset also features imaging metadata such as image laterality, view type,\nand presence of hardware, enhancing its value for research and model development. MRKR addresses\nsignificant gaps in existing datasets by offering a more representative sample for studying osteoarthritis\nand related outcomes, particularly among minority populations, thereby providing a valuable resource\nfor clinicians and researchers.\nAcknowledgments - We would like to thank MD.ai for assistance with image de-identification.\n",

    "Name": "Animal Tracking - Acoustic Telemetry - Quality controlled detections",
    "Description": "Since 2007, the Integrated Marine Observing System’s Animal Tracking Facility (formerly known as the Australian Animal Tracking And Monitoring System (AATAMS)) has established a permanent array of acoustic receivers around Australia to detect the movements of tagged marine animals in coastal waters. Simultaneously, the Animal Tracking Facility developed a centralised national database (https://animaltracking.aodn.org.au/) to encourage collaborative research across the Australian research community and provide unprecedented opportunities to monitor broad-scale animal movements. The resulting dataset comprises observations of tagged animals in Australian waters collected by IMOS infrastructure as well as receivers operated by independent research projects and  organisations. This dataset constitutes a valuable resource facilitating meta-analysis of animal movement, distributions, and habitat use, and is important for relating species distribution shifts with environmental covariates.\n\nThis dataset comprises all available (2007 – ongoing) quality-controlled animal detections collected across the collaborative, continental IMOS network for a range of aquatic species (fish, sharks, rays, reptiles, and mammals). Here, raw animal detections collated via the IMOS Australian Animal Acoustic Telemetry Database have been quality-controlled as per Hoenner et al. (2018). This dataset is updated on a six-monthly basis.\n\nNote - There is a static snapshot of the database (up until 2017) (http://dx.doi.org/10.4225/69/5979810a7dd6f), and this has been documented in a Scientific Data Publication (Hoenner et al. 2018).",

    "Description": "Fisheries Vessels as Ships of Opportunities (FishSOOP) is an IMOS Sub-Facility working with fishers to collect real-time temperature and depth data by installing equipment on a network of commercial fishing vessels using a range of common fishing gear.\n\nEvery day, fishing vessels operate broadly across the productive areas of Australia’s Exclusive Economic Zone where we have few subsurface ocean measurements. The FishSOOP Sub-Facility is utilising this observing opportunity to cost-effectively increase the spatial and temporal resolution of subsurface temperature data in Australia’s inshore, shelf, upper-slope, and offshore waters. The data is currently returned to each fishing boat in near-real time, so skippers can relate their catches to temperature-at-depth information.  The same data will also be collated to provide oceanographers with quality-controlled data for ground-truthing coastal models and to improve analysis and forecasts of oceanic conditions.\n\nThe IMOS funded data collection, follows on from a Fisheries Research and Development Corporation (FRDC) funded pilot project (2022-007) with the University of New South Wales, Fishwell Consulting and IMOS. In the first year of the project 32 commercial fishing vessels had been equipped with sensors. They covered a range of fishing vessels, including scallop dredges, tuna longlines, shark gillnets, otter board trawlers, lobster pots, fish traps, prawn trawlers, squid jigs, and danish seines. We also had a pre-trial test with one boat the year prior, with the sensor installed on a trawler.",

    "Description": "NOAA has generated a multi-decadal reanalysis and reforecast data set to accompany the next-generation version of its ensemble prediction system, the Global Ensemble Forecast System, version 12 (GEFSv12). Accompanying the real-time forecasts are “reforecasts” of the weather, that is, retrospective forecasts spanning the period 2000-2019. These reforecasts are not as numerous as the real-time data; they were generated only once per day, from 00 UTC initial conditions, and only 5 members were provided, with the following exception. Once weekly, an 11-member reforecast was generated, and these extend in lead time to +35 days. \n",

    "Description": "The Terra Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER) Level 1 Precision Terrain Corrected Registered At-Sensor Radiance (AST_L1T) data contains calibrated at-sensor radiance, which corresponds with the ASTER Level 1B ([AST_L1B](https://doi.org/10.5067/ASTER/AST_L1B.004)) that has been geometrically corrected and rotated to a north-up UTM projection. The AST_L1T is created from a single resampling of the corresponding ASTER L1A ([AST_L1A](https://doi.org/10.5067/ASTER/AST_L1A.004)) product. The bands available in the AST_L1T depend on the bands in the AST_L1A and can include up to three Visible and Near Infrared (VNIR) bands, six Shortwave Infrared (SWIR) bands, and five Thermal Infrared (TIR) bands. The AST_L1T dataset does not include the aft-looking VNIR band 3. The AST_L1T product has a spatial resolution of 15 meters (m) for the VNIR bands, 30 m for the SWIR bands, and 90 m for the TIR bands.\n\nThe precision terrain correction process incorporates GLS2000 digital elevation data with derived ground control points (GCPs) to achieve topographic accuracy for all daytime scenes where correlation statistics reach a minimum threshold. Alternate levels of correction are possible (systematic terrain, systematic, or precision) for scenes acquired at night or that otherwise represent a reduced quality ground image (e.g., cloud cover).\n\nFor daytime images, if the VNIR or SWIR telescope collected data and precision correction was attempted, each precision terrain corrected image will have an accompanying independent quality assessment. It will include the geometric correction available for distribution as both a text file and single band browse images with the valid GCPs overlaid.\n\nThis multi-file product also includes georeferenced full resolution browse images. The number of browse images and the band combinations of the images depends on the bands available in the corresponding [AST_L1A](https://doi.org/10.5067/ASTER/AST_L1A.004) dataset.\n\nKnown Issues\n\n* Since October 1, 2017, a correction addresses zero-filled scans in low-latitude, ascending orbit (nighttime) TIR data. Additional details are available in the ASTER L1T User Advisory.\n* Data from the SWIR bands collected after April 2008 may show anomalous saturation and striping. See the ASTER SWIR User Advisory for further information.\n\nImprovements/Changes from Previous Versions\n\n* Enhanced Geolocation Accuracy: Version 4 uses Collection 2 Ground Control Points (GCPs) compared against Global Land Survey (GLS) 2000 standards to improve positional accuracy.\n* Radiometric Calibration Update: Version 4 applies Radiometric Calibration Coefficient Version 5 (RCC V5) to improve the radiometric accuracy of the raw DNs, based on research by [Tsuchida and others (2020)](https://doi.org/10.3390/rs12030427), published in Remote Sensing.\nRead our doc on how to get AWS Credentials to retrieve this data: https://data.lpdaac.earthdatacloud.nasa.gov/s3credentialsREADME",

    "Description": "The 2020 Census Production Settings Demographic and Housing Characteristics (DHC) Approximate Monte Carlo (AMC) method seed Privacy Protected Microdata File (PPMF0) and PPMF replicates (PPMF1, PPMF2, ..., PPMF50) are a set of microdata files intended for use in estimating the magnitude of error(s) introduced by the 2020  Census Disclosure Avoidance System (DAS) into the 2020 Census Redistricting Data Summary File (P.L. 94-171), the Demographic and Housing Characteristics File, and the Demographic Profile.  <br/> <br/> The PPMF0 was the source of the publicly released, official 2020 Census data products referenced above, and was created by executing the 2020 DAS TopDown Algorithm (TDA) using the confidential  2020 Census Edited File (CEF) as the initial input; the official location for the PPMF0 is [on the United States Census Bureau FTP server](https://www2.census.gov/programs-surveys/decennial/2020/data/privacy-protected-microdata-file/), but we also include a copy of it here for convenience. The replicates were then created by executing the 2020 DAS TDA repeatedly with the PPMF0 as its initial input.  <br/> <br/> Inspired by analogy to the use of bootstrap methods in non-private contexts, U.S. Census Bureau (USCB) researchers explored whether simple calculations  based on comparing each PPMFi to the PPMF0 could be used to reliably estimate the scale of errors introduced by the 2020 DAS, and generally found this approach  worked well. <br/> <br/> The PPMF0 and PPMFi files contained here are provided so that external researchers can estimate properties of DAS-introduced error without privileged  access to internal USCB-curated data sets; further information on the estimation methodology can be found in [Ashmead et. al 2024](https://github.com/uscensusbureau/AMC_Confidence_Intervals/blob/main/Approx_Monte_Carlo_confidence_interval_paper.pdf).  <br/> <br/> The 2020 DHC AMC seed PPMF0 and PPMF replicates have been cleared for public dissemination by the USCB Disclosure Review Board (CBDRB-FY22-DSEP-004).  The PPMF0 and PPMF replicates contain all Person and Units attributes necessary to produce the 2020 Census Redistricting Data Summary File (P.L. 94-171), the Demographic and Housing Characteristics File, and the Demographic Profile for both the United States and  Puerto Rico, and include geographic detail down to the Census Block level. They do not include attributes specific to either the Detailed DHC-A or Detailed DHC-B  products; in particular, data on Major Race (e.g., White Alone) is included, but data on Detailed Race (e.g., Cambodian) is not included in the PPMF0 and replicates.",

    "Description": "The Cell Painting Gallery is a collection of image datasets created using the [Cell Painting](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27560178/) assay. \nThe images of cells are captured by microscopy imaging, and reveal the response of various labeled cell components to whatever treatments are tested, which can include genetic perturbations, chemicals or drugs, or different cell types. \nThe datasets can be used for diverse applications in basic biology and pharmaceutical research, such as identifying disease-associated phenotypes, understanding disease mechanisms, and predicting a drug’s activity, toxicity, or mechanism of action ([Chandrasekaran et al 2020](https://carpenter-singh-lab.broadinstitute.org/files/anne/files/141_Chandrasekaran_NatRevDrugDiscov_2020.pdf)). \nThis collection is maintained by the [Carpenter–Singh lab](https://carpenter-singh-lab.broadinstitute.org/) and the [Cimini lab](https://cimini-lab.broadinstitute.org/) at the [Broad Institute](https://www.broadinstitute.org/).\nA human-friendly listing of datasets, instructions for accessing them, and other documentation is at the [corresponding GitHub page](https://github.com/broadinstitute/cellpainting-gallery) about the Gallery.\n",

    "Description": "This repository is a re-analysis of the NCBI Sequence Read Archive (SRA), December 2023 freeze, to make it more accessible. The SRA is an open access database of biological sequences, containing raw data from high-throughput DNA and RNA sequencing platforms. It is the largest database of public DNA sequences worldwide, containing a wealth of genomic diversity across all living organisms. This repository contains Logan, a set of compressed FASTA files for all individual SRA accessions, in the form of unitigs and contigs. Borrowing methods from the realm of genome assembly, unitigs preserve nearly all the information present in the original sample, whereas contigs get rid of variations to increase sequence lengths. Altogether, Logan recapitulates the information present in the SRA while making it an order of magnitude more accessible due to 20-100x smaller size and higher quality genomic content.",

The human eye is a very sensitive tool and it is the only tool currently used to reliably detect new comets in SOHO data - particularly comets that are very faint and embedded in the instrument background noise. Bright comets can be easily detected in the LASCO data by relatively simple automated algorithms, but the majority of comets observed by the instrument are extremely faint, noise-level observations. Comets in SOHO/LASCO data are dynamic and morphologically diverse objects, and thus computationally highly complex to detect and track.\n",

    "Name": "NapierOne Mixed File Dataset",
    "Description": "NapierOne is a modern cybersecurity mixed file data set, primarily aimed at, but not limited to, ransomware detection and forensic analysis. The dataset contains over 500,000 distinct files, representing 44 distinct popular file types. It was designed to address the known deficiency in research reproducibility and improve consistency by facilitating research replication and repeatability. The data set was inspired by the Govdocs1 data set and it is intended that ‘NapierOne’ be used as a complement to this original data set. An investigation was performed with the goal of determining the common files types currently in use. No specific research was found that explicitly provided this information, so an alternative consensus approach was employed. This involved combining the findings from multiple sources of file type usage into an overall ranked list. After which 5,000 real-world example files were gathered, and a specific data subset was created, for each of the common file types identified. In some circumstances, multiple data subsets were created for a specific file type, each subset representing a specific characteristic for that file type. For example, there are multiple data subsets for the ZIP file type with each subset containing examples of a specific compression method. Ransomware execution tends to produce files that have high entropy, so examples of file types that naturally have this attribute are also present. The resulting entire data set comprises of more than 90 separate data subsets divided between 44 distinct file types, resulting in over 500,000 unique files in total. Currently, the data set contains examples of the following file types APK, BIN, BMP, CSS, CSV, DOC, DOCX, DWG, ELF, EPS,EPUB, EXE, GIF, GZIP, HTML, ICS, JS, JPG, JSON, MKV, MP3, MP4, ODS, OXPS, PDF, PNG, PPT, PPTX, PS1, RAR, SVG, TAR, TIF, TXT, WEBP, XLS, XLSX, XML, ZIP, ZLIB, 7Zip",

    "Description": "NASA produces skin sea surface temperature (SST) products from the Infrared (IR) channels of the Moderate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) onboard the Terra satellite. Terra was launched by NASA on December 18, 1999, into a sun synchronous, polar orbit with a daylight descending node at 10:30 am, to study the global dynamics of the Earth atmosphere, land and oceans. The MODIS captures data in 36 spectral bands at a variety of spatial resolutions.  Two SST products can be present in these files. The first is a skin SST produced for both day and night observations, derived from the long wave IR 11 and 12 micron wavelength channels, using a modified nonlinear SST algorithm intended to provide continuity with SST derived from heritage and current NASA sensors. At night, a second SST product is produced using the mid-infrared 3.95 and 4.05 micron channels which are unique to MODIS; the SST derived from these measurements is identified as SST4. The SST4 product has lower uncertainty, but due to sun glint can only be produced at night. MODIS L2P SST data have a 1 km spatial resolution at nadir and are stored in 288 five minute granules per day. Full global coverage is obtained every two days, with coverage poleward of 32.3 degree being complete each day. The production of MODIS L2P SST files is part of the Group for High Resolution Sea Surface Temperature (GHRSST) project, and is a joint collaboration between the NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL), the NASA Ocean Biology Processing Group (OBPG), and the Rosenstiel School of Marine and Atmospheric Science (RSMAS). Researchers at RSMAS are responsible for SST algorithm development, error statistics and quality flagging, while the OBPG, as the NASA ground data system, is responsible for the production of daily MODIS ocean products. JPL acquires MODIS ocean granules from the OBPG and reformats them to the GHRSST L2P netCDF specification with complete metadata and ancillary variables, and distributes the data as the official Physical Oceanography Data Archive (PO.DAAC) for SST.  The R2019.0 supersedes the previous R2014.0 datasets which can be found at  https://doi.org/10.5067/GHMDT-2PJ02\nRead our doc on how to get AWS Credentials to retrieve this data: https://archive.podaac.earthdata.nasa.gov/s3credentialsREADME",

The dataset ranges from the latest high-resolution aerial imagery down to 5cm in some urban areas to lower resolution satellite imagery that provides full coverage of mainland New Zealand, Chathams and other offshore islands. It also includes historical imagery that has been scanned from film, orthorectified (removing distortions) and georeferenced (correctly positioned) to create a unique and crucial record of changes to the New Zealand landscape. <br/>\nAll of the imagery files are [Cloud Optimised GeoTIFFs](https://www.cogeo.org/) using lossless WEBP compression for the main image and lossy WEBP compression for the overviews. These image files are accompanied by [STAC metadata](https://stacspec.org/). The imagery is organised by region and survey.\n",

Each of the maps has an assessed average accuracy of over 75%. \n\nThese maps have been improved from Impact Observatory’s previous release and provide\na relative reduction in the amount of anomalous change between classes,\nparticularly between “Bare” and any of the vegetative classes\n“Trees,” “Crops,” “Flooded Vegetation,” and “Rangeland”.\nThis updated time series of annual global maps is also re-aligned to match the ESA UTM tiling grid for Sentinel-2 imagery. \n\nData can be accessed directly from the Registry of Open Data on AWS, from the [STAC 1.0.0 endpoint](https://api.impactobservatory.com/stac-aws/collections/io-10m-annual-lulc/items), or from the [IO Store](https://www.impactobservatory.com/maps-for-good/) for a specific Area of Interest (AOI).   \n",

All data is made public by the State of Louisiana for the benefit of its citizens. This flood prediction data can be used by federal, state, and local decision makers as well as private citizens to assess the flood risk they face and make sound science-based decisions for response and adaptation.\n",

    "Description": "NOAA's Climate Data Records (CDRs) are robust, sustainable, and scientifically sound climate records that provide trustworthy information on how, where, and to what extent the land, oceans, atmosphere and ice sheets are changing. These datasets are thoroughly vetted time series measurements with the longevity, consistency, and continuity to assess and measure climate variability and change. NOAA CDRs are vetted using standards established by the National Research Council (NRC).<br/><br/>\nClimate Data Records are created by merging data from surface, atmosphere, and space-based systems across decades. NOAA’s Climate Data Records provides authoritative and traceable long-term climate records. NOAA developed CDRs by applying modern data analysis methods to historical global satellite data. This process can clarify the underlying climate trends within the data and allows researchers and other users to identify economic and scientific value in these records. NCEI maintains and extends CDRs by applying the same methods to present-day and future satellite measurements.<br/><br/>\nOceanic Climate Data Records are measurements of oceans and seas both surface and subsurface as well as frozen state variables.\n",

For each contact, we assign an intent so that we can manage the request more easily. The data we present in this release includes 548k contacts with 118 intents from 70k sellers sampled from recent years. There are 3 columns. 1. De-identified seller id - seller_id_anon; 2. Noisy inter-arrival time in the unit of hour between contacts - interarrival_time_hr_noisy; 3. An integer that represents the contact intent - contact_intent. Note that, to balance the need between data anonymization and usefulness, we randomly perturbed the interarrival time in an intricate way such that the temporal pattern are preserved and seller identity are anonymized to the largest extent. We also note that for each seller_id_anon, the interarrival_time_hr_noisy are already arranged in chonological order, the first contact_intent_id_anon is always the origin when sellers begin to sell with us and the interarrival_time_hr_noisy for each seller_id_anon are all relative with respect to the previous contact. A straightforward use case of the data is to predict the next timestamp and intent of a user given the user's history.",

    "Description": "The Unified Forecast System (UFS) is a community-based, coupled, comprehensive Earth Modeling System. The [UFS Coastal application](https://github.com/oceanmodeling/ufs-coastal-app) is a project under development by NOAA and NCAR, which supports coastal forecasting requirements based on UFS standards. The coupling infrastructure for UFS Coastal App is currently being developed based on a fork of the ufs-weather-model (UFS-WM), with additional coastal model-components including SCHISM, ADCIRC, ROMS, and FVCOM, as well as additional infrastructure to support coastal coupling of WW3 and CICE. The [model-level repository](https://github.com/oceanmodeling/ufs-weather-model) contains the model code and external submodules needed to build the UFS coastal model executable and the associated model components. \n<br/>\n<br/>\nThe UFS Coastal Regression Test (RT) system is a type of testing built into the software development that ensures that changes to the model-level code and associated model-components do not break the existing functionality of the code. The number and type of tests currently in the RT system suite are evolving along with current dependencies such as UFS-WM and ESMF libraries. Currently, at least one RT case exists for each coastal model. The status and descriptions of the existing RT cases is available via the [UFS Coastal Wiki page](https://github.com/oceanmodeling/ufs-weather-model/wiki/Current-Status-of-UFS%E2%80%90Coastal-Implementation). These are currently regularly tested on NOAA/MSU Hercules platform, and to a lesser frequency on TACC/Frontera.\n<br/>\n<br/>\nEach of the regression tests require a set of input data files and configuration files. The configuration files include namelist and model configuration files which can be found within the [UFS-Coastal model code repository](https://github.com/oceanmodeling/ufs-weather-model). The RT framework also includes baseline data for each configuration. When code changes are not expected to alter baseline results, regression tests will be performed against current baseline and as a result, the regression test log files are created – revealing a summary of no change within the results. If the code changes are expected to alter model results, impact to the regression tests will be specified in the pull request. The code changes and model results will be reviewed and confirmed. Once the model results are confirmed, a new baseline will be generated. In some cases, new input data will need to be added or old data will need to be replaced, these data will be put in the input data location with proper timestamp, and regression tests will be performed with the updated data sets.\n",

    "Description": "The Unified Forecast System (UFS) is a community-based, coupled, comprehensive Earth modeling system. It supports \"[multiple applications](https://ufscommunity.org/science/aboutapps/)\" covering different forecast durations and spatial domains. The Land Data Assimilation (DA) System is an offline version of the Noah Multi-Physics (Noah-MP) land surface model (LSM) used in the UFS Weather Model (WM). Its data assimilation framework uses \"[Joint Effort for Data assimilation Integration - JEDI] (https://www.jcsda.org/jcsda-project-jedi)\" software. The offline Noah-MP LSM is a stand-alone, uncoupled model used to execute land surface simulations. In this traditional uncoupled mode, near-surface atmospheric forcing data is required as input. Sample forcing and restart data are provided in this data bucket. <br/> <br/> The Noah-MP LSM has evolved through community efforts to pursue and refine a modern-era LSM suitable for use in the National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) operational weather and climate prediction models. This collaborative effort continues with participation from entities such as NCAR, NCEP, NASA, and university groups. <br/> <br/> For details regarding the physical parameterizations used in Noah-MP, see \"[Niu, et al. (2011)] (https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2010JD015139)\". The \"[Land DA User’s Guide] (https://land-da.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)\" provides information on building and running the Land DA System in offline mode. Users can access additional technical support via the \"[UFS GitHub Discussions] (https://github.com/NOAA-EPIC/land-offline_workflow/discussions)\" for the Land DA System. <br/>",

Data product is quality controlled bulk air-sea fluxes and input observations. Research Vessel Real Time Air-Sea Fluxes, equips the Marine National Facility (MNF) (Research Vessels Southern Surveyor and Investigator), the Australian Antarctic Division (Research and Supply Vessels Aurora Australis and Nuyina), and Research Vessel Tangaroa with \"climate quality\" meteorological measurement systems, capable of providing high quality air-sea flux measurements and delivered to researchers on a near real-time basis. Obtaining the full set of air-sea fluxes essential for climate studies requires observations of: wind, air and sea temperature, humidity, pressure, precipitation, long- and short-wave radiation. The existing ship meteorological sensor sets are completed with IMOS instruments and a comprehensive annual calibration program implemented. Data streams are fed into existing ship data management systems, and broadcast via satellite back to Australia routinely. The observations are quality controlled at the Bureau of Meteorology and air-sea fluxes calculated using the COARE Bulk Flux algorithm. A daily file of calculated bulk fluxes and the observations used in the calculation are generated shortly after 0000UTC and provided to IMOS.",

    "Name": "2010 Census Production Settings Redistricting Data (P.L. 94-171) Demonstration Noisy Measurement File",
    "Description": "The 2010 Census Production Settings Redistricting Data (P.L. 94-171) Demonstration Noisy Measurement File (2023-04-03) is an intermediate output of the 2020 Census Disclosure Avoidance System (DAS) TopDown Algorithm (TDA) (as described in Abowd, J. et al [2022] https://doi.org/10.1162/99608f92.529e3cb9 , and implemented in https://github.com/uscensusbureau/DAS_2020_Redistricting_Production_Code). The NMF was produced using the official “production settings,” the final set of algorithmic parameters and privacy-loss budget allocations, that were used to produce the 2020 Census Redistricting Data (P.L. 94-171) Summary File and the 2020 Census Demographic and Housing Characteristics File.\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThe NMF consists of the full set of privacy-protected statistical queries (counts of individuals or housing units with particular combinations of characteristics) of confidential 2010 Census data relating to the redistricting data portion of the 2010 Demonstration Data Products Suite – Redistricting and Demographic and Housing Characteristics File – Production Settings (2023-04-03). These statistical queries, called “noisy measurements” were produced under the zero-Concentrated Differential Privacy framework (Bun, M. and Steinke, T [2016] https://arxiv.org/abs/1605.02065; see also Dwork C. and Roth, A. [2014] https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~aaroth/Papers/privacybook.pdf) implemented via the discrete Gaussian mechanism (Cannone C., et al., [2023] https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.00010), which added positive or negative integer-valued noise to each of the resulting counts. The noisy measurements are an intermediate stage of the TDA prior to the post-processing the TDA then performs to ensure internal and hierarchical consistency within the resulting tables. The Census Bureau has released these 2010 Census demonstration data to enable data users to evaluate the expected impact of disclosure avoidance variability on 2020 Census data. The 2010 Census Production Settings Redistricting Data (P.L.94-171) Demonstration Noisy Measurement File (2023-04-03) has been cleared for public dissemination by the Census Bureau Disclosure Review Board (CBDRB-FY22-DSEP-004).\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThe data includes zero-Concentrated Differentially Private (zCDP) (Bun, M. and Steinke, T [2016]) noisy measurements, implemented via the discrete Gaussian mechanism. These are estimated counts of individuals and housing units included in the 2010 Census Edited File (CEF), which includes confidential data initially collected in the 2010 Census of Population and Housing. The noisy measurements included in this file were subsequently post-processed by the TopDown Algorithm (TDA) to produce the 2010 Census Production Settings Privacy-Protected Microdata File - Redistricting (P.L. 94-171) and Demographic and Housing Characteristics File (2023-04-03) (https://www2.census.gov/programs-surveys/decennial/2020/program-management/data-product-planning/2010-demonstration-data-products/04-Demonstration_Data_Products_Suite/2023-04-03/). As these 2010 Census demonstration data are intended to support study of the design and expected impacts of the 2020 Disclosure Avoidance System, the 2010 CEF records were pre-processed before application of the zCDP framework. This pre-processing converted the 2010 CEF records into the input-file format, response codes, and tabulation categories used for the 2020 Census, which differ in substantive ways from the format, response codes, and tabulation categories originally used for the 2010 Census.\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThe NMF provides estimates of counts of persons in the CEF by various characteristics and combinations of characteristics including their reported race and ethnicity, whether they were of voting age, whether they resided in a housing unit or one of 7 group quarters types, and their census block of residence after the addition of discrete Gaussian noise (with the scale parameter determined by the privacy-loss budget allocation for that particular query under zCDP). Noisy measurements of the counts of occupied and vacant housing units by census block are also included. Lastly, data on constraints—information into which no noise was infused by the Disclosure Avoidance System (DAS) and used by the TDA to post-process the noisy measurements into the 2010 Census Production Settings Privacy-Protected Microdata File - Redistricting (P.L. 94-171) and Demographic and Housing Characteristics File (2023-04-03) —are provided.\n",

    "Name": "Ocean Radar - Capricorn bunker group site - Wave - Delayed mode",
    "Description": "The Capricorn Bunker Group site is in the southern region  of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park World Heritage Area (GBR).  The HF ocean radar coverage is from the coast to beyond the edge of the continental shelf.  This is an area where the East Australian Current (EAC) meanders as it moves south from the Swain Reefs and loses touch with the western land boundary.  The area is dynamic with warm EAC water recirculating and being wind-driven northwards along the coast inside the GBR lagoon.  The recirculating warm water contrasts with the upwelling tendency of the parts of the EAC which continue to move southwards.  The CBG radar is ideally placed to follow filaments of different water types and to investigate their impacts on coral reefs and fisheries.  \n\nApplications of the CBG radar data are in the frequency and location of regional upwelling that fuels productivity, and in the connectivity between reefs and islands.  At the central point of the CBG area of coverage is the  Heron Island Research Station which hosts many coral reef and ecology research programs.  The data will also be useful for validation of the operational Bluelink model, and the embedded higher resolution Whole-of-Reef model.   \n\nThe CBG HF ocean radar is a WERA phased array system with 12-element receive arrays located at Tannum Sands (-23.942 S, 151.371 E) and Lady Elliot Island (-24.111 S, 152.713 E).  These radars operate at a frequency of 8.348 MHz, with a bandwidth of 33 KHz and a maximum range of 200 Km and a range resolution of 4.5 Km.  Within the HF radar coverage area surface currents are measured.  Data are also collected from which wind directions and significant wave height can be calculated.  \n\nThe capital funding for this system was provided originally as an ARC LEIF Grant, assisted by contributions from James Cook University, The University of Queensland, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and the Australian Institute of Marine Science.\n\nThis site was decommissioned in April 2017.",

    "Description": "This repository contains references to datasets published to the NOAA Open Data Dissemination Program. These reference datasets serve as index files to the original data by mapping to the [Zarr V2 specification](https://zarr-specs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/v2/v2.0.html). When multidimensional model output is read through zarr, data can be lazily loaded (i.e. retrieving only the data chunks needed for processing) and data reads can be scaled horizontally to optimize object storage read performance. \n<br/>\n<br/>\nThe process used to optimize the data is called [kerchunk](https://fsspec.github.io/kerchunk/). RPS runs [the workflow](https://asascience-open.github.io/nextgen-dmac/ingest/ingest-prototype.html) in their AWS cloud environment every time a new data notification is received from a relevant source data bucket.\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThese are the current datasets being cloud-optimized.

For example, if the source file is\n<br/>\nnos.dbofs.fields.f024.20240527.t00z.nc\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThen the cloud-optimized filename is the same, with “.zarr” appended\n<br/>\nnos.dbofs.fields.f024.20240527.t00z.nc.zarr\n<br/>\n<br/>\n**Data Aggregations**\n<br/>\nWe also produce virtual aggregations to group an entire forecast model run, and the “best” available forecast.\n<br/>\nBest Forecast (continuously updated) -  nos.dbofs.fields.best.nc.zarr\nFull Model Run -  nos.dbofs.fields.forecast.[YYYYMMDD].t[CC]z.nc.zarr\n<br/>\n- CC is the model run cycles, 00, 06, 12, 18 , or 03, 09, 15, 21 for nowcast and forecast runs\n<br/>\n- YYYY = year, MM = month, DD = day\n<br/>\n<br/>\nCloud optimization workflows supported by [RPS Group](https://www.rpsgroup.com/services/oceans-and-coastal/metocean-science-and-technology/), a Tetra Tech Company\n",

    "Name": "Satellite - Sea surface temperature - Level 3 - Single sensor - 1 day - Day and night time - Southern Ocean",
    "Description": "This is a single-sensor SSTfnd product for a single 24 hour period, derived using observations from AVHRR instruments on all available NOAA polar-orbiting satellites.  It is provided as a 0.02deg x 0.02deg cylindrical equidistant projected map over the Southern Ocean region 3°E to 158°W, 27°S to 78°S.  Each grid cell contains the 24 hour average of all the highest available quality SSTs that overlap with that cell, weighted by the area of overlap.  The diagram at https://help.aodn.org.au/satellite-data-product-information/ indicates where this product fits within the GHRSST suite of NOAA/AVHRR products. The SSTfnd is derived by adding a constant 0.17 degC to the SSTskin observations after rejecting observations with low surface wind speeds (<6m/s by day and <2m/s at night) (see http://www.bom.gov.au/amoj/docs/2011/beggs.pdf). Matchups with buoy SSTfnd observations indicate typical 2014 biases of < 0.01 degC and standard deviations of 0.6 degC. Refer to the IMOS SST products web page at http://imos.org.au/sstproducts.html and Beggs et al. (2013) at http://imos.org.au/sstdata_references.html for further information.",

The Study’s purpose is to identify the nutritional, environmental, lifestyle and genetic risk factors for cancer and other diseases. The Golden Oldie’s study enrolled an additional cohort of golden retrievers that had reached the age of 12 years or older and had not yet been diagnosed with a malignant cancer. This population can be used as a control group for conditions with high mortality in younger age. This dataset contains the data for ~1.1 million genetic markers from 3224 unique individual dogs processed using Axiom Canine Genotyping Array Sets A and B. Of the 3244 individual samples, 3024 were from the Golden Retriever Lifetime Study cohort and 200 from the Golden Oldies cohort. \n",

    "Name": "GPM IMERG Early Precipitation L3 Half Hourly 0.1 degree x 0.1 degree V07 (GPM_3IMERGHHE) at GES DISC",
    "Description": "Version 07B is the current version of the IMERG data sets. Older versions will no longer be available and have been superseded by Version 07.\n\nThe Integrated Multi-satellitE Retrievals for GPM (IMERG) is the unified U.S. algorithm that provides the multi-satellite precipitation product for the U.S. GPM team.\n\nThe precipitation estimates from the various precipitation-relevant satellite passive microwave (PMW) sensors comprising the GPM constellation are computed using the 2021 version of the Goddard Profiling Algorithm (GPROF2021), then gridded, intercalibrated to the GPM Combined Ku Radar-Radiometer Algorithm (CORRA) product, and merged into half-hourly 0.1°x0.1° (roughly 10x10 km) fields. Note that CORRA is adjusted to the monthly Global Precipitation Climatology Project (GPCP) Satellite-Gauge (SG) product over high-latitude ocean to correct known biases.\n\nThe half-hourly intercalibrated merged PMW estimates are then input to both a Morphing-Kalman Filter (KF) Lagrangian time interpolation scheme based on work by the Climate Prediction Center (CPC) and the Precipitation Estimation from Remotely Sensed Information using Artificial Neural Networks (PERSIANN) Dynamic Infrared–Rain Rate (PDIR) re-calibration scheme. In parallel, CPC assembles the zenith-angle-corrected, intercalibrated merged geo-IR fields and forwards them to PPS for input to the PERSIANN-CCS algorithm (supported by an asynchronous re-calibration cycle) which are then input to the KF morphing (quasi-Lagrangian time interpolation) scheme.\n\nThe KF morphing (supported by an asynchronous KF weights updating cycle) uses the PMW and IR estimates to create half-hourly estimates. Motion vectors for the morphing are computed by maximizing the pattern correlation of successive hours within each of the precipitation (PRECTOT), total precipitable liquid water (TQL), and vertically integrated vapor (TQV) data fields provided by the Modern-Era Retrospective Analysis for Research and Applications, Version 2 (MERRA-2) and Goddard Earth Observing System model Version 5 (GEOS-5) Forward Processing (FP) for the post-real-time (Final) Run and the near-real-time (Early and Late) Runs, respectively. The vectors from PRECTOT are chosen if available, else from TQL, if available, else from TQV. The KF uses the morphed data as the “forecast” and the IR estimates as the “observations”, with weighting that depends on the time interval(s) away from the microwave overpass time. The IR becomes important after about ±90 minutes away from the overpass time. Variable averaging in the KF is accounted for in a routine (Scheme for Histogram Adjustment with Ranked Precipitation Estimates in the Neighborhood, or SHARPEN) that compares the local histogram of KF morphed precipitation to the local histogram of forward- and backward-morphed microwave data and the IR.\n\nThe IMERG system is run twice in near-real time:\n\n\"Early\" multi-satellite product ~4 hr after observation time using only forward morphing and\n\"Late\" multi-satellite product ~14 hr after observation time, using both forward and backward morphing\nand once after the monthly gauge analysis is received:\n\n\"Final\", satellite-gauge product ~4 months after the observation month, using both forward and backward morphing and including monthly gauge analyses.\n\nIn V07, the near-real-time Early and Late half-hourly estimates have a monthly climatological concluding calibration based on averaging the concluding calibrations computed in the Final, while in the post-real-time Final Run the multi-satellite half-hourly estimates are adjusted so that they sum to the Final Run monthly satellite-gauge combination. In all cases the output contains multiple fields that provide information on the input data, selected intermediate fields, and estimation quality. In general, the complete calibrated precipitation, precipitation, is the data field of choice for most users.\n\nPrecipitation phase is a diagnostic variable computed using analyses of surface temperature, humidity, and pressure. \nRead our doc on how to get AWS Credentials to retrieve this data: https://data.gesdisc.earthdata.nasa.gov/s3credentialsREADME",

    "Description": "The Level-3 OPERA Sentinel-1 Surface Displacement (DISP) product is generated through interferometric time-series analysis of Level-2 Coregistered Sentinel-1 Single Look Complex (CSLC) datasets. Using a hybrid Persistent Scatterer (PS) and Distributed Scatterer (DS) approach, this product quantifies Earth's surface displacement in the radar line-of-sight. The DISP products enable the detection of anthropogenic and natural surface changes, including subsidence, tectonic deformation, and landslides. \n\nThe OPERA DISP suite comprises complementary datasets derived from Sentinel-1 and NISAR inputs, designated as DISP-S1 and DISP-NI, respectively. Each product, created per acquisition, adheres to a consistent structure, HDF5 file format, file-naming convention, and a 30 m spatial posting. This collection specifically includes DISP-S1 products, derived from Sentinel-1 data. \n\nDISP-S1 products provide spatial coverage across North America, encompassing the United States, U.S. territories within 200 km of the U.S. border, Canada, and mainland countries from the southern U.S. border to Panama. These products are generated from Sentinel-1 Interferometric Wide (IW) swath mode acquisitions starting in mid-2016. \n\nThe OPERA DISP-S1 product contains modified Copernicus Sentinel data (2016-2025).\nRead our doc on how to get AWS Credentials to retrieve this data: https://cumulus.asf.alaska.edu/s3credentialsREADME",

    "Description": "M2I3NVASM (or  inst3_3d_asm_Nv) is an instantaneous 3-dimensional 3-hourly data collection in Modern-Era Retrospective analysis for Research and Applications version 2 (MERRA-2).  This collection consists of assimilations of meteorological parameters at 72 model layers, such as temperature, wind components, vertical pressure velocity, water vapor, and layer height.  The data field is available every three hour starting from 00:00 UTC, e.g.:  00:00, 03:00, … , 21:00 UTC. Section 4.2 of the MERRA-2 File Specification document provides pressure values nominal for a 1000 hPa surface pressure and refers to the top edge of the layer. The lev=1 is for the top layer, and lev=72 is for the bottom (or surface) model layer. \n\nMERRA-2 is the latest version of global atmospheric reanalysis for the satellite era produced by NASA Global Modeling and Assimilation Office (GMAO) using the Goddard Earth Observing System Model (GEOS) version 5.12.4.  The dataset covers the period of 1980-present with the latency of ~3 weeks after the end of a month. \n\nData Reprocessing:  Please check “Records of MERRA-2 Data Reprocessing and Service Changes” linked from the “Documentation” tab on this page.  Note that a reprocessed data filename is different from the original file.\n\nMERRA-2 Mailing List: Sign up to receive information on reprocessing of data, changing of tools and services, as well as data announcements from GMAO. Contact the GES DISC Help Desk (gsfc-dl-help-disc@mail.nasa.gov) to be added to the list.\n\nQuestions: If you have a question, please read \"MERRA-2 File Specification Document\",  “MERRA-2 Data Access – Quick Start Guide”, and FAQs linked from the ”Documentation” tab on this page.  If that does not answer your question, you may post your question to the NASA Earthdata Forum (forum.earthdata.nasa.gov) or email the GES DISC Help Desk (gsfc-dl-help-disc@mail.nasa.gov).\nRead our doc on how to get AWS Credentials to retrieve this data: https://data.gesdisc.earthdata.nasa.gov/s3credentialsREADME",

    "Description": "The Bonney Coast (BONC) HF ocean radar system covers an area of the Bonney Coast, South Australia, which has a recurring annual upwelling feature near to the coast that significantly changes the ecosystem from one of warm water originating in Western Australia, to one dominated by cold upwelling water from off the continental shelf.  The dynamics of this area and the relationship between ocean circulation, chemistry and sediments control the larval species and the higher marine species and ecosystems in which they forage.  \n\nThe data from this site provide linking observations between the Southern Ocean and NSW through processes that occur on weekly to El Nino time scales.  \n\nThe BONC HF ocean radar system consists of two SeaSonde crossed loop direction finding stations located at Nora Creina (37.329 S 139.850 E) and Blackfellows Cave (37.940 S 140.457 E).  These radars operate at a frequency of 5.211 MHz, with a bandwidth of 50 KHz, a maximum range of 200 Km and a range resolution of 3 Km.  Within the HF radar coverage area surface currents are measured.\n\nThis site was decommissioned in March 2017.",

    "Description": "Tabula Sapiens is a benchmark, first-draft human cell atlas of over 1.1M cells from 28 organs of 24 normal human subjects. \nThis work is the product of the Tabula Sapiens Consortium. \nTaking the organs from the same individual controls for genetic background, age, environment, and epigenetic effects, \nand allows detailed analysis and comparison of cell types that are shared between tissues. \nOur work creates a detailed portrait of cell types as well as their distribution and variation in gene expression \nacross tissues and within the endothelial, epithelial, stromal and immune compartments.\nWe have built directly on our unique skills, experience, and data infrastructure from Tabula Muris and Tabula Muris Senis \nto create a high-quality human reference dataset and portal at a 10-fold larger scale from these prior efforts.\n\nA critical factor in the Tabula projects is our large collaborative network of PIs with deep expertise at preparation of diverse organs, \nenabling all organs from a subject to be successfully processed within a single day. \nWe have built the logistics and infrastructure capable of tracking hundreds of samples and thousands of 384-well plates \nfrom tissue through sample prep, library construction and on to sequencing and ultimately computational \nand expert cell annotation with tight quality control.\n\nTabula Sapiens leverages our network of human tissue experts and a close collaboration with a Donor Network West, \na not-for-profit organ procurement organization. We use their experience to balance and assign cell types \nfrom each tissue compartment and optimally mix high-quality plate-seq data and high-volume droplet-based data to \nprovide a broad and deep benchmark atlas.\n\nThe first version of Tabula Sapiens contained nearly 500,000 cells from 24 organs of 15 normal human subjects.\nWith the second version, Tabula Sapiens 2.0, we have built an integrated map of 28 tissues collected across 24 donors. \nNine new donors and four new tissues were collected and analyzed together with the original Tabula Sapiens 1.0 dataset. \nAll tissues and organs, with the exception of the respective reproductive organs, were profiled from both male (n=11) and female (n=13) donors. \nThe donor's age ranges from 22 to 74 years old, offering one of the most comprehensive molecular profiles of human tissues across the \nadult lifespan (7 donors under the age of 40, 11 donors between 40 and 60, and 6 donors over 60 years of age).\n\nOur goal is to make sequence data rapidly and broadly available to the scientific community as a community resource and \nwe welcome collaborative interaction on the project and analyses. By accessing these data, you agree to cite our work as \nThe Tabula Sapiens Consortium, Science 376, eabl4896 (2022) if using the original v1 dataset, or to cite our \nwork as The Tabula Sapiens Consortium, biorxiv (2024) if you are using the Tabula Sapiens v2 data release. \nAll processed data is available (see below) and the raw data is browsable from AWS. Redistribution of these data should \ninclude the full text of the data use policy.\n\nIf you wish to gain access to the raw fastq files, please submit a request using the controlled access form to sign the data use agreement, \nupon which we may grant you access to the files. Raw fastq files should not be transferred to any third party.\n",

    "Description": "The NOAA20 satellite platform carries a VIIRS sensor that observes sunlight reflected from within the ocean surface layer at multiple wavelengths. These multi-spectral measurements are used to infer the diffuse attenuation coefficient (Kd) at 490nm wavelength which provides information on how light is attenuated in the water column. It is defined as the scaling length of the exponential decrease of the downwelling irradiance, and has units (m^-1). The VIIRS K490 product estimates Kd at 490nm wavelength, using a semi-empirical model based on the ratio of water leaving radiances at 490nm and 555nm. The algorithm is described at https://oceancolor.gsfc.nasa.gov/atbd/kd/.",

    "Name": "NASA High Energy Astrophysics Mission Data",
    "Description": "NASA data for high energy astrophysics (generally x-ray and gamma-ray domains) is made available here by the High Energy Astrophysics Science Archive Research Center. The HEASARC hosts the full data archives of over 30 different missions spanning 50 years. The data archive for each mission will contain a range of data types from spacecraft housekeeping and raw photon event list data up to high level science-ready products such as images, light curves (time series), and energy spectra.\n<br/><br/>\nThis is a relatively modest total data volume but contains significant complexity and heterogeneity among the different missions. Data provided here are stored in the Flexible Image Transport System ([FITS](https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/heasarc/fits.html)) format common in astronomy. Higher level products are further defined to be consistent between missions following [data model standards](https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/heasarc/ofwg/ofwg_recomm.html) agreed by the community and maintained by the HEASARC. Analysis of these data may require software also provided by HEASARC, the [HEASoft package](https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/software/lheasoft/), consisting of tools generic to all FITS data, generic to all HEASARC-compliant data, and/or specific to individual missions as appropriate. Some missions provide standard science-ready data products, while others provide low-level data types and software to generate science-ready products from them. See the links for each mission for more information on how to use the data.\n<br/><br/>\nThe [HEASARC Website](https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/) also has archive browsing tools where you can query for observations corresponding to temporal and spatial constraints among others. These tools will ultimately point to files located on the archive by giving a URL beginning with the path https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/FTP/. The data that are provided in the ODR follow the same structure, so when our tools give an https access URL, a user can simply swap in s3://nasa-heasarc/ for the first part of that URL and get a cloud URI. Note also that some selections have been made to what has been copied to the ODR, while the HEASARC archive itself remains the definitive and legacy source for the complete datasets.\n<br/><br/>\nThe HEASARC also provides user support, both generic and mission-specific, through a set of email helpdesks available through the website's [Feedback page](https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/Feedback).\n",

Numerous two-dimensional multiple-sensor products offer assistance for hail, wind, tornado, quantitative precipitation estimations, convection, icing, and turbulence diagnosis.\n<br/>\n<br/>\nMRMS is being used to develop and test new Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) NextGen products in addition to advancing techniques in quality control, icing detection, and turbulence in collaboration with the National Center for Atmospheric Research, the University Corporation for Atmospheric Research, and Lincoln Laboratories.\n<br/>\n<br/>\nMRMS was deployed operationally in 2014 at the National Center for Environmental Prediction (NCEP). All of the 100+ products it produces are available via NCEP to all of the WFOs, RFCs, CWSUs and NCEP service centers. In addition, the MRMS product suite is publicly available to any other entity who wishes to access and use the data. Other federal agencies that use MRMS include FEMA, DOD, FAA, and USDA.\n<br/>\n<br/>  \nMRMS is the proposed operational version of the WDSS-II and NMQ research systems.\n<br/>\n<br/> \nThe MRMS system was jointly developed in cooperation with the Cooperative Institute for Severe and High-Impact Weather Research and Operations (CIWRO) (formerly CIMMS), and the University of Oklahoma retains the right to commercially license the software. Several leading weather information companies have previously licensed the MRMS system from the University of Oklahoma for commercial use, although the software is available for government at no cost.\n<br/>\n",

The primary mission in a circular polar orbit 100-km above the surface lasted from October 20, 2007 until October 31, 2008. An extended mission was then conducted in lower orbits (averaging 50km above the surface) from November 1, 2008 until the SELENE mission ended with Kaguya impacting the Moon on June 10, 2009. These data were collected in monoscopic observing mode. To create these analysis ready data, we have taken the JAXA Data ARchives and Transmission System (DARTS) archived data, map projected the data to equirectangular or polar stereographic (pole centered) based on the center latitude of the observation, and converted to a Cloud Optimized GeoTiff (COG) for online streaming. These data use a priori spacecraft ephemerides (for the nominal mission) and improved, but not controlled spacecraft ephemerides for the extended mission. Therefore, these uncontrolled data are not guaranteed to co-register with other data sets.\n",

    "Description": "This dataset includes *hourly* sea surface temperature and current data collected by satellite-tracked surface drifting buoys (\"drifters\") of the [NOAA Global Drifter Program](https://www.aoml.noaa.gov/phod/gdp). The [Drifter Data Assembly Center (DAC) at NOAA’s Atlantic Oceanographic and Meteorological Laboratory (AOML)](https://www.aoml.noaa.gov/phod/gdp/data.php) has applied quality control procedures and processing to edit these observational data and obtain estimates at regular hourly intervals. The data include positions (latitude and longitude), sea surface temperatures (total, diurnal, and non-diurnal components) and velocities (eastward, northward) with accompanying uncertainty estimates. Metadata include identification numbers, experiment number, start location and time, end location and time, drogue loss date, death code, manufacturer, and drifter type. <br /> <br /> Please note that data from the Global Drifter Program are also available at [6-hourly intervals](https://doi.org/10.25921/7ntx-z961) but derived via alternative methods. The 6-hourly dataset goes back further in time (1979) and may be more appropriate for studies of long-term, low frequency patterns of the oceanic circulation.

These rovers can collect rock and soil samples and can take measurements that can be used to determine their chemical makeup. <br/><br/>\nBecause communication between rovers and Earth is severely constrained, with limited transfer rates and short daily communication windows, scientists have a limited time to analyze the data and make difficult inferences about the chemistry in order to prioritize the next operations and send those instructions back to the rover. <br/><br/>\nThis project aimed at building a model to automatically analyze evolved gas analysis mass spectrometry (EGA-MS) data collected for Mars exploration in order to help the scientists in their analysis of understanding the past habitability of Mars. <br/><br/>\nMore information are available at https://mars.nasa.gov/msl/spacecraft/instruments/sam/ and the data from Mars are available and described at https://pds-geosciences.wustl.edu/missions/msl/sam.htm. <br/><br/>\nWe request that you cite the following ackowledgement when using the data provided from this NASA Project: \"NASA provided support for the development of SAM.

    "Name": "NOAA Coastal Lidar Data",
    "Description": "Lidar (light detection and ranging) is a technology that can measure the 3-dimentional location of objects, including the solid earth surface. The data consists of a point cloud of the positions of solid objects that reflected a laser pulse, typically from an airborne platform. In addition to the position, each point may also be attributed by the type of object it reflected from, the intensity of the reflection, and other system dependent metadata. The NOAA Coastal Lidar Data is a collection of lidar projects from many different sources and agencies, geographically focused on the coastal areas of the United States of America. The data is provided in Entwine Point Tiles (EPT; https://entwine.io) format, which is a lossless streamable octree of the point cloud, and in LAZ format. Datasets are maintained in their original projects and care should be taken when merging projects. The coordinate reference system for the data is The NAD83(2011) UTM zone appropriate for the center of each data set for EPT and geographic coordinates for LAZ. Vertically they are in the orthometric datum appropriate for that area (for example, NAVD88 in the mainland United States, PRVD02 in Puerto Rico, or GUVD03 in Guam). The geoid model used is reflected in the data set resource name. <br>The data are organized under directories entwine and laz for the EPT and LAZ versions respectively. Some datasets are not in EPT format, either because the dataset is already in EPT on the USGS public lidar site, they failed to build or their content does not work well in EPT format. Topobathy lidar datasets using the topobathy domain profile do not translate well to EPT format.",

    "Name": "HLS Sentinel-2 Multi-spectral Instrument Surface Reflectance Daily Global 30m v2.0",
    "Description": "The Harmonized Landsat Sentinel-2 (HLS) project provides consistent surface reflectance data from the Operational Land Imager (OLI) aboard the joint NASA/USGS Landsat 8 satellite and the Multi-Spectral Instrument (MSI) aboard Europe’s Copernicus Sentinel-2A, Sentinel-2B, and Sentinel-2C satellites. The combined measurement enables global observations of the land every 2–3 days at 30-meter (m) spatial resolution. The HLS project uses a set of algorithms to obtain seamless products from OLI and MSI that include atmospheric correction, cloud and cloud-shadow masking, spatial co-registration and common gridding, illumination and view angle normalization, and spectral bandpass adjustment. \n\nThe HLSS30 product provides 30-m Nadir Bidirectional Reflectance Distribution Function (BRDF)-Adjusted Reflectance (NBAR) and is derived from Sentinel-2A, Sentinel-2B, and Sentinel-2C MSI data products. The HLSS30 and [HLSL30](https://doi.org/10.5067/HLS/HLSL30.002) products are gridded to the same resolution and Military Grid Reference System ([MGRS](https://hls.gsfc.nasa.gov/products-description/tiling-system/)) tiling system and thus are “stackable” for time series analysis.\n\nThe HLSS30 product is provided in Cloud Optimized GeoTIFF (COG) format, and each band is distributed as a separate COG. There are 13 bands included in the HLSS30 product along with four angle bands and a quality assessment (QA) band. See the User Guide for a more detailed description of the individual bands provided in the HLSS30 product.\n\nKnown Issues\n\n* Unrealistically high aerosol and low surface reflectance over bright areas: The atmospheric correction over bright targets occasionally retrieves unrealistically high aerosol and thus makes the surface reflectance too low. High aerosol retrievals, both false high aerosol and realistically high aerosol, are masked when quality bits 6 and 7 are both set to 1 (see Table 9 in the [User Guide](https://lpdaac.usgs.gov/documents/1698/HLS_User_Guide_V2.pdf)); the corresponding spectral data should be discarded from analysis.\n\n* Issues over high latitudes: For scenes greater than or equal to 80 degrees north, multiple overpasses can be gridded into a single MGRS tile resulting in an L30 granule with data sensed at two different times. In this same area, it is also possible that Landsat overpasses that should be gridded into a single MGRS tile are actually written as separate data files. Finally, for scenes with a latitude greater than or equal to 65 degrees north, ascending Landsat scenes may have a slightly higher error in the BRDF correction because the algorithm is calibrated using descending scenes.\n\n* Fmask omission errors: There are known issues regarding the Fmask band of this data product that impacts HLSL30 data prior to April of 2022. The HLS Fmask data band may have omission errors in water detection for cases where water detection using spectral data alone is difficult, and omission and commission errors in cloud shadow detection for areas with great topographic relief. This issue does not impact other bands in the dataset.\n\n* Inconsistent snow surface reflectance between Landsat and Sentinel-2: The HLS snow surface reflectance can be highly inconsistent between Landsat and Sentinel-2. When assessed on same-day acquisitions from Landsat and Sentinel-2, Landsat reflectance is generally higher than Sentinel-2 reflectance in the visible bands.\n\n* Unrealistically high snow surface reflectance in the visible bands: By design, the Land Surface Reflectance Code (LaSRC) atmospheric correction does not attempt aerosol retrieval over snow; instead, a default aerosol optical thickness (AOT) is used to drive the snow surface reflectance. If the snow detection fails, the full LaSRC is used in both AOT retrieval and surface reflectance derivation over snow, which produces surface reflectance values as high as 1.6 in the visible bands. This is a common problem for spring images at high latitudes.\n\n* Unrealistically low surface reflectance surrounding snow/ice: Related to the above, the AOT retrieval over snow/ice is generally too high. When this artificially high AOT is used to derive the surface reflectance of the neighboring non-snow pixels, very low surface reflectance will result. These pixels will appear very dark in the visible bands. If the surface reflectance value of a pixel is below -0.2, a NO_DATA value of -9999 is used. In Figure 1, the pixels in front of the glaciers have surface reflectance values that are too low.  \n\n* Unrealistically low reflectance surrounding clouds: Like for snow, the HLS atmospheric correction does not attempt aerosol retrieval over clouds and a default AOT is used instead. But if the cloud detection fails, an artificially high AOT will be retrieved over clouds. If the high AOT is used to derive the surface reflectance of the neighboring cloud-free pixels, very low surface reflectance values will result. If the surface reflectance value of a pixel is below -0.2, a NO_DATA value of -9999 is used. \n\n* Unusually low reflectance around other bright land targets: While the HLS atmospheric correction retrieves AOT over non-cloud, non-snow bright pixels, the retrieved AOT over bright targets can be unrealistically high in some cases, similar to cloud or snow. If this unrealistically high AOT is used to derive the surface reflectance of the neighboring pixels, very low surface reflectance values can result as shown in Figure 2. If the surface reflectance value of a pixel is below -0.2, a NO_DATA value of -9999 is used. These types of bright targets are mostly man-made, such as buildings, parking lots, and roads.  \n\n* Dark plumes over water: The HLS atmospheric correction does not attempt aerosol retrieval over water. For water pixels, the AOT retrieved from the nearest land pixels is used to derive the surface reflectance, but if the retrieval is incorrect, e.g. from a cloud pixel, this high AOT will create dark stripes over water, as shown in Figure 3. This happens more often over large water bodies, such as lakes and bays, than over narrow rivers.  \n\n* Landsat WRS-2 Path/Row boundary in L30 reflectance: HLS performs atmospheric correction on Landsat Level 1 images in the original Worldwide Reference System 2 (WRS2) path/row before the derived surface reflectance is reprojected into Military Grid Reference System (MGRS) tiles. If a WRS-2 Landsat image is very cloudy, the AOT from a few remaining clear pixels might be used for the atmospheric correction of the entire image. The AOT that is used can be quite different from the value for the adjacent row in the same path, which results in an artificial abrupt change from one row to the next, as shown in Figure 4. This occurrence is very rare.  \n \n* Landsat WRS2 path/row boundary in cloud masks: The cloud mask algorithm Fmask creates mask labels by applying thresholds to the histograms of some metrics for each path/row independently. If two adjacent rows in the same path have distinct distributions within the metrics, abrupt changes in masking patterns can appear across the row boundary, as shown in Figure 5. This occurrence is very rare.  \n\n* Fmask configuration was deficient for 2-3 months in 2021: The HLS installation of Fmask failed to include auxiliary digital elevation model (DEM) and European Space Agency (ESA) Global Surface Water Occurrence data for a 2-3 month run in 2021. This impacted the masking results over water and in mountainous regions. \n\n* The reflectance “scale_factor” and “offset” for some L30 and S30 bands were not set: The HLS reflectance scaling factor is 0.0001 and offset is 0. However, this information was not set in the Cloud Optimized GeoTIFF (COG) files of some bands for a small number of granules. The lack of this information creates a problem for automatic conversion of the reflectance data, requiring explicit scaling in applications. The problem has been corrected, but the affected granules have not been reprocessed. \n\n* Incomplete map projection information: For a time, HLS imagery was produced with an incomplete coordinate reference system (CRS). The metadata contains the Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM) zone and coordinates necessary to geolocate pixels within the image but might not be in a standard form, especially for granules produced early in the HLS mission. As a result, an error will occur in certain image processing packages due to the incomplete CRS. The simplest solution is to update to the latest version of Geospatial Data Abstraction Library (GDAL) and/or rasterio, which use the available information without error. \n\n* False northing of 10^7 for the L30 angle data: The L30 and S30 products do not use a false northing for the UTM projection, and the angle data are supposed to follow the same convention. However, the L30 angle data incorrectly uses a false northing of 10^7. There is no problem with the angle data itself, but the false northing needs to be set to 0 for it to be aligned with the reflectance.\n\n* L30 from Landsat L1GT scenes: Landsat L1GT scenes were not intended for HLS due to their poor geolocation. However, some scenes made it through screening for a short period of HLS production. L1GT L30 scenes mainly consist of extensive cloud or snow that can be eliminated using the Fmask quality bits layer. Users can also identify an L1GT-originated L30 granule by examining the HLS cmr.xml metadata file.\n\n* The UTC dates in the L30/S30 filenames may not be the local dates: UTC dates are used by ESA and the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) in naming their Level 1 images, and HLS processing retains this information to name the L30 and S30 products. Landsat and Sentinel-2 overpass eastern Australia and New Zealand around 10AM local solar time, but this area is in either UTC+10:00 or +11:00 zone; therefore, the UTC time for some orbits is in fact near the end of the preceding UTC day. For example, HLS.S30.T59HQS.2016117T221552.v2.0 was acquired in the 22nd hour of day 117 of year 2016 in UTC, but the time was 10:15:52 of day 118 locally. Approximately 100 minutes later HLS.S30.T56JML.2016117T235252.v2.0 was acquired in the next orbit in eastern Australia.  \n\n     This issue also occurs for Landsat. For example, HLS.L30.T59HQS.2016117T221209.v2.0 was acquired on the same day as the first S30 example given above, but both on day 118 of 2016 locally. Adding to the confusion for L30, in the same region, Landsat 8 and 9 can each overpass once in one of the two adjacent WRS-2 Paths (91/92/93) over a two-day period on a local calendar, but based on UTC time, the two overpasses can appear to be on the same day. For example, in the following seemingly same-day pair, the second L30 is actually for day 168 locally:  \n     HLS.L30.T55GCN.2023167T000407.v2.0  \n     HLS.L30.T55GCN.2023167T235747.v2.0  \n     Bear in mind, the date peculiarity for the data occurs when the overpass time is during the late hours of a UTC day.  \n\n* The atmospheric ancillary data from the wrong date was used for LaSRC: Related to the above, for eastern Australia and New Zealand, L30 and S30 surface reflectance on certain days was created using the atmospheric ancillary data from a date that was one day too early. The exact geographic extent of the affected HLS products and the impact on the surface reflectance quality are under investigation. Practice caution when using data with overpass times during the late hours of a UTC day.\n\n* Duplicates in L30: The Landsat 9 acquisitions from October 2021 to March 2023 in Landsat Collection 2 were reprocessed by USGS in March 2023. This reprocessing updated the overpass time by a fraction of a second for some scenes. Since HLS uses overpass time as part of the L30 filename, the older L30 granules were not automatically overwritten due to the different filenames. For example, the first L30 granule in the following pair originated from an older version of L1TP of Landsat 9 with the second granule originating from the reprocessed version.  \nHLS.L30.T11SLC.2022166T182646.v2.0  \nHLS.L30.T11SLC.2022166T182645.v2.0  \nThere are other causes of duplicate L30 granules, but the overall number of duplicates is very small.\n\n* Poor Geolocation: A large amount of granules that were processed for May through July 2023 were created with L1GT input scenes which were deemed undesirable due to a poor geolocation issue. These granules were removed from the archive. (see the full list of removed [granules](https://lpdaac.usgs.gov/documents/2161/L30_L1GT_granules_May_July_2023.csv))\n\nImprovements/Changes from Previous Versions\n\n* Aerosol QA bits from the USGS Land Surface Reflectance Code (LaSRC) model output have been added into the Function of Mask (Fmask) data layer. The added two bits indicate the aerosol levels: high, medium, low, and climatology aerosol.\nRead our doc on how to get AWS Credentials to retrieve this data: https://data.lpdaac.earthdatacloud.nasa.gov/s3credentialsREADME",

    "Name": "A Global Drought and Flood Catalogue from 1950 to 2016",
    "Description": "Hydrological extremes, in the form of droughts and floods, have impacts on a wide range of sectors including water availability, food security, and energy production, among others. Given continuing large impacts of droughts and floods and the expectation for significant regional changes projected in the future, there is an urgent need to provide estimates of past events and their future risk, globally. However, current estimates of hydrological extremes are not robust and accurate enough, due to lack of long-term data records, standardized methods for event identification, geographical inconsistencies and data uncertainties. To tackle these challenges, we develop the first Global Drought and Flood Catalogue (GDFC) [He et al., 2020] for 1950-2016 by merging the latest in situ and remote-sensing datasets with state-of-the-art land surface and hydrodynamic modeling to provide a continuous and consistent estimate of the terrestrial water cycle and its extremes. This GDFC also includes an unprecedented level of detailed analysis of drought and large-scale flood events using a multivariate risk assessment framework, which incorporates regional spatial-temporal characteristics (i.e., duration, spatial extent, severity) and global hazard maps for different return periods. This catalogue forms a basis for analyzing the changing risk of droughts and floods and can underscore national and international climate change assessments and provide a key reference for climate change studies and climate model evaluations.\n",

    "Name": "GPM IMERG Late Precipitation L3 1 day 0.1 degree x 0.1 degree V07 (GPM_3IMERGDL) at GES DISC",
    "Description": "Version 07 is the current version of the data set. Older versions will no longer be available and have been superseded by Version 07.\n\nThe Integrated Multi-satellitE Retrievals for GPM (IMERG) IMERG is a NASA product estimating global surface precipitation rates at a high resolution of 0.1° every half-hour beginning 2000.  It is part of the joint NASA-JAXA Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM) mission, using the GPM Core Observatory satellite as the standard to combine precipitation observations from an international constellation of satellites using advanced techniques.  IMERG can be used for global-scale applications as well as over regions with sparse or no reliable surface observations.  The fine spatial and temporal resolution of IMERG data allows them to be accumulated to the scale of the application for increased skill.  IMERG has three Runs with varying latencies in response to a range of application needs: rapid-response applications (Early Run, 4-h latency), same/next-day applications (Late Run, 14-h latency), and post-real-time research (Final Run, 3.5-month latency).  While IMERG strives for consistency and accuracy, satellite estimates of precipitation are expected to have lower skill over frozen surfaces, complex terrain, and coastal zones.  As well, the changing GPM satellite constellation over time may introduce artifacts that affect studies focusing on multi-year changes.\n\nThis dataset is the GPM Level 3 IMERG  Late Daily  10 x 10 km (GPM_3IMERGDL) derived from the half-hourly GPM_3IMERGHHL. The derived result represents a Late expedited estimate of the daily mean precipitation rate in mm/day. The dataset is produced by first computing the mean precipitation rate in (mm/hour) in every grid cell, and then multiplying the result by 24.  This minimizes the possible dry bias in versions before \"07\", in the simple daily totals  for cells where less than 48 half-hourly observations are valid for the day. The latter under-sampling is very rare in the combined microwave-infrared (and rain gauge in the final) dataset, variable \"precipitation\",  and appears in higher latitudes. Thus, in most cases users of global \"precipitation\" data will not notice any difference. This correction, however, is noticeable in the high-quality microwave retrieval, variable \"MWprecipitation\", where the occurrence of less than 48 valid half-hourly samples per day is very common. The counts of the valid half-hourly samples per day have always been provided as a separate variable, and users of daily data were advised to pay close attention to that variable and use it to calculate the correct precipitation daily rates. Starting with version \"07\", this is done in production to minimize possible misinterpretations of the data. The counts are still provided in the data, but they are only given to gauge the significance of the daily rates, and reconstruct the simple totals if someone wishes to do so. \n\nThe latency of the derived Late daily product is a couple of minutes after the last granule of GPM_3IMERGHHL for the UTC data day is received at GES DISC. Since the target latency of GPM_3IMERGHHL is 14 hours, the daily should appear no earlier than 14 hours after the closure of the UTC day. For information on the original data (GPM_3IMERGHHL), please see the Documentation (Related URL).  \n\nThe daily mean rate (mm/day) is derived by first computing the mean precipitation rate (mm/hour) in a grid cell for the data day, and then multiplying the result by 24.  Thus, for every grid cell we have                \n\nPdaily_mean     = SUM{Pi * 1[Pi valid]} / Pdaily_cnt  * 24, i=[1,Nf]\n\nWhere:\nPdaily_cnt = SUM{1[Pi valid]}\n\nPi              - half-hourly input, in (mm/hr)\nNf              - Number of half-hourly files per day, Nf=48\n1[.]            - Indicator function; 1 when Pi is valid, 0 otherwise\nPdaily_cnt      - Number of valid retrievals in a grid cell per day.\n\nGrid cells for which Pdaily_cnt=0, are set to fill value in the Daily files.\nNote that Pi=0 is a valid value.\n\nPdaily_cnt are provided in the data files as variables \"precipitation_cnt\" and \"MWprecipitation_cnt\", for correspondingly the microwave-IR-gauge and microwave-only retrievals. They are only given to gauge the significance of the daily rates, and reconstruct the simple totals if someone wishes to do so. \n\nThere are various ways the daily error could be estimated from the source half-hourly random error (variable \"randomError\"). The daily error provided in the data files is calculated in a fashion similar to the daily mean precipitation rate. First, the mean of the squared half-hourly \"randomError\"  for the day is computed, and the resulting (mm^2/hr) is converted to (mm^2/day). Finally, square root is taken to get the result in (mm/day):\n\nPerr_daily = { SUM{ (Perr_i)^2 * 1[Perr_i valid] ) } / Ncnt_err  * 24}^0.5, i=[1,Nf]\nNcnt_err   = SUM( 1[Perr_i valid] )\n\nwhere:\nPerr_i\t\t- half-hourly input, \"randomError\", (mm/hr)\nPerr_daily\t- Magnitude of the daily error, (mm/day)\nNcnt_err\t\t- Number of valid half-hour error estimates\n\nAgain, the sum of squared \"randomError\" can be reconstructed, and other estimates can be derived using the available counts in the Daily files.\n\n\nRead our doc on how to get AWS Credentials to retrieve this data: https://data.gesdisc.earthdata.nasa.gov/s3credentialsREADME",

These datasets are thoroughly vetted time series measurements with the longevity, consistency, and continuity to assess and measure climate variability and change. NOAA CDRs are vetted using standards established by the National Research Council (NRC).<br/><br/>\nClimate Data Records are created by merging data from surface, atmosphere, and space-based systems across decades. NOAA’s Climate Data Records provides authoritative and traceable long-term climate records. NOAA developed CDRs by applying modern data analysis methods to historical global satellite data. This process can clarify the underlying climate trends within the data and allows researchers and other users to identify economic and scientific value in these records. NCEI maintains and extends CDRs by applying the same methods to present-day and future satellite measurements.<br/><br/>\nTerrestrial CDRs are composed of sensor data that have been improved and quality controlled over time, together with ancillary calibration data.\n",

The mosaic DEM tiles are assembled from multiple strip DEMs with the intention of providing a more consistent and comprehensive product over large areas. EarthDEM data is constructed from in-track and cross-track high-resolution (~0.5 meter) imagery acquired by the Maxar constellation of optical imaging satellites.

    "Name": "(EXPERIMENTAL) NOAA GraphCast Global Forecast System (GFS) (EXPERIMENTAL)",
    "Description": "The GraphCast Global Forecast System (GraphCastGFS) is an experimental system set up by the National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) to produce medium range global forecasts. The horizontal resolution is a 0.25 degree latitude-longitude grid (about 28 km). The model runs 4 times a day at 00Z, 06Z, 12Z and 18Z cycles. Major atmospheric and surface fields including temperature, wind components, geopotential height, specific humidity, and vertical velocity, are available. The products are 6 hourly forecasts up to 10 days. The data format is GRIB2.\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThe GraphCastGFS system is an experimental weather forecast model built upon the pre-trained Google DeepMind’s GraphCast Machine Learning Weather Prediction (MLWP) model. The GraphCast model is implemented as a message-passing graph neural network (GNN) architecture with “encoder-processor-decoder” configuration. It uses an icosahedron grid with multiscale edges and has around 37 million parameters. This model is pre-trained with ECMWF’s ERA5 reanalysis data. The GraphCastGFSl takes two model states as initial conditions (current and 6-hr previous states) from NCEP 0.25 degree GDAS analysis data and runs GraphCast (37 levels) and GraphCast_operational (13 levels) with a pre-trained model provided by GraphCast. Unit conversion to the GDAS data is conducted to match the input data required by GraphCast and to generate forecast products consistent with GFS from GraphCastGFS’ native forecast data.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n**The GraphCastGFS version 2 made the following changes from the GraphcastCastGFS version 1.**\n<br/>\n1. The 37 vertical levels model is removed due to the storage restriction and limited accuracy.\n<br/>\n2. The 13 levels graphcast ML model was fine-tuned with NCEP’s GDAS data as inputs and ECMWF ERA5 data as ground truth from 20210323 to 20220901, validated from 20220901 to 20230101. Evaluation is done with forecasts from 20230101-20240101. The new weights created from the training are used to create global forecasts. It is important to note that the GraphCastGFS v1 model weights obtained from Google’s DeepMInd were provided based on 12 timesteps training with ERA5 data, while the GraphCastGFS v2 model weights resulted from training with 14 timesteps with GDAS and ERA5 data that significantly increased the accuracy of the forecasts compared with GraphCastGFS V1.\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThe input data generated from the GDAS data as GraphCast input is provided under input/ directory. An example of file names is shown below\n<br/>\n<br/>\nsource-gdas_date-2024022000_res-0.25_levels-13_steps-2.nc\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThe files are under forecasts_13_levels/. There are 40 files under each directory covering a 10 day forecast. An example of file name is listed below\n<br/>\n<br/>\ngraphcastgfs.t00z.pgrb2.0p25.f006\n<br/>\n<br/>\n*The GraphCastGFS version 2.1 change log:*\n<br/>\n<br/>\n1. Starting from 06 cycle on 20240710, the forecast length is increased from 10 days to 16 days.\n<br/>\n<br/>\nPlease note that this NOAA GraphCastGFS Model was produced using a code package released by Google DeepMind.

It includes a range of atmospheric and oceanic variables—such as temperature, humidity, winds, salinity, and currents—covering global conditions at a nominal horizontal resolution of ¼ degree, enabling detailed weather analysis.\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThe dataset was generated by replaying the coupled UFS model against pre-existing external reanalyses; ERA5 for atmospheric data and ORAS5 for ocean and ice dynamics. Each simulation stream was initialized from these reanalyses, which were pre-processed for the UFS model components, including the GFDL Finite-Volume Cubed-Sphere Dynamical Core (FV3; 25 km, 127 vertical levels) and the Modular Ocean Model (MOM6; ¼ degree tri-polar grid, 72 vertical levels). This replay methodology enforces a predetermined model state while allowing cross-component fluxes and unconstrained processes to be computed.\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFor the land surface, NOAA’s JEDI-based land data assimilation system incorporated snow depth observations from the NCEI Global Historical Climatology Network (GHCN) and satellite-derived snow cover from the U.S. National Ice Center. The JEDI Sea-ice Ocean and Coupled Analysis system (SOCA) adjusted sea-ice thickness and concentration for consistency with ORAS5.\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThe original dataset spanned January 1994 to October 2023, with plans for ongoing updates and a 1-degree version covering 1958 to 2023. The dataset is hosted on AWS and GCP cloud services, courtesy of the NOAA Open Data Dissemination program.

    "Name": "DHARANI Developing Human-Brain Atlas",
    "Description": "We introduce DHARANI, the first online platform with three-dimensional (3D) histological reconstructions of the developing human brain from 14 to 24 gestational weeks (GW) across the five fetal brains. DHARANI features 5132 Nissl, hematoxylin and eosin stained, 20 µm coronal and sagittal sections, postmortem MRI, and a neuroanatomical atlas with 466 annotated sections covering ∼500 brain structures. It is accessible online at https://brainportal.humanbrain.in/publicview/index.html. The 3D reconstruction enables a volumetric view of the fetal brain, allowing visualization in all three planes akin to MRI, previously unachievable with histological datasets from the fetal brain. This allowed qualitative assessment of the growth of brain regions and layers throughout the second trimester. “DHARANI” documents the initiation of sulci, with the lateral fissure, calcarine, parieto-occipital, and cingulate sulci, at 14 GW. The central and postcentral sulci appear by 24 GW; however, cytoarchitectonic boundaries become visible before sulcal patterns. Cortical plate (CP) lamination begins at 24 GW in the parietal and occipital cortices. The frontal cortex lacks lamination at 24 GW, although putative Betz cells are already visible and show early patterning in the intermediate zone. The cell-sparse layer between the CP and subplate, containing late migratory neurons, begins in the orbital cortex at 14 GW and reaches the frontal cortex by 17 GW. The appearance of the honeycomb pattern in the occipital and parietal cortex occurs after 14 GW. Additionally, we describe the development of the thalamic pregeniculate with the rotation of the lateral geniculate nucleus. Cerebellar nuclei and an early Purkinje cell layer appear by 21 GW in the already foliated cerebellar cortex. The collection of > 650,000 images have been made available in this Open Data bucket to enable efficient access and analysis of the this dataset.\n",

    "Name": "HLS Landsat Operational Land Imager Surface Reflectance and TOA Brightness Daily Global 30m v2.0",
    "Description": "The Harmonized Landsat Sentinel-2 (HLS) project provides consistent surface reflectance (SR) and top of atmosphere (TOA) brightness data from a virtual constellation of satellite sensors. The Operational Land Imager (OLI) is housed aboard the joint NASA/USGS Landsat 8 and Landsat 9 satellites, while the Multi-Spectral Instrument (MSI) is mounted aboard Europe’s Copernicus Sentinel-2A, Sentinel-2B, and Sentinel-2C satellites. The combined measurement enables global observations of the land every 2–3 days at 30-meter (m) spatial resolution. The HLS project uses a set of algorithms to obtain seamless products from OLI and MSI that include atmospheric correction, cloud and cloud-shadow masking, spatial co-registration and common gridding, illumination and view angle normalization, and spectral bandpass adjustment.\n\nThe HLSL30 product provides 30-m Nadir Bidirectional Reflectance Distribution Function (BRDF)-Adjusted Reflectance (NBAR) and is derived from Landsat 8/9 OLI data products. The [HLSS30](https://doi.org/10.5067/HLS/HLSS30.002) and HLSL30 products are gridded to the same resolution and Military Grid Reference System ([MGRS](https://hls.gsfc.nasa.gov/products-description/tiling-system/)) tiling system and thus are “stackable” for time series analysis.\n\nThe HLSL30 product is provided in Cloud Optimized GeoTIFF (COG) format, and each band is distributed as a separate file. There are 11 bands included in the HLSL30 product along with one quality assessment (QA) band and four angle bands. See the User Guide for a more detailed description of the individual bands provided in the HLSL30 product.\n\nKnown Issues\n\n* Unrealistically high aerosol and low surface reflectance over bright areas: The atmospheric correction over bright targets occasionally retrieves unrealistically high aerosol and thus makes the surface reflectance too low. High aerosol retrievals, both false high aerosol and realistically high aerosol, are masked when quality bits 6 and 7 are both set to 1 (see Table 9 in the [User Guide](https://lpdaac.usgs.gov/documents/1698/HLS_User_Guide_V2.pdf)); the corresponding spectral data should be discarded from analysis.\n\n* Issues over high latitudes: For scenes greater than or equal to 80 degrees north, multiple overpasses can be gridded into a single MGRS tile resulting in an L30 granule with data sensed at two different times. In this same area, it is also possible that Landsat overpasses that should be gridded into a single MGRS tile are actually written as separate data files. Finally, for scenes with a latitude greater than or equal to 65 degrees north, ascending Landsat scenes may have a slightly higher error in the BRDF correction because the algorithm is calibrated using descending scenes.\n\n* Fmask omission errors: There are known issues regarding the Fmask band of this data product that impacts HLSL30 data prior to April of 2022. The HLS Fmask data band may have omission errors in water detection for cases where water detection using spectral data alone is difficult, and omission and commission errors in cloud shadow detection for areas with great topographic relief. This issue does not impact other bands in the dataset.\n\n* Inconsistent snow surface reflectance between Landsat and Sentinel-2: The HLS snow surface reflectance can be highly inconsistent between Landsat and Sentinel-2. When assessed on same-day acquisitions from Landsat and Sentinel-2, Landsat reflectance is generally higher than Sentinel-2 reflectance in the visible bands.\n\n* Unrealistically high snow surface reflectance in the visible bands: By design, the Land Surface Reflectance Code (LaSRC) atmospheric correction does not attempt aerosol retrieval over snow; instead, a default aerosol optical thickness (AOT) is used to drive the snow surface reflectance. If the snow detection fails, the full LaSRC is used in both AOT retrieval and surface reflectance derivation over snow, which produces surface reflectance values as high as 1.6 in the visible bands. This is a common problem for spring images at high latitudes.\n\n* Unrealistically low surface reflectance surrounding snow/ice: Related to the above, the AOT retrieval over snow/ice is generally too high. When this artificially high AOT is used to derive the surface reflectance of the neighboring non-snow pixels, very low surface reflectance will result. These pixels will appear very dark in the visible bands. If the surface reflectance value of a pixel is below -0.2, a NO_DATA value of -9999 is used.\n\n* Unrealistically low reflectance surrounding clouds: Like for snow, the HLS atmospheric correction does not attempt aerosol retrieval over clouds and a default AOT is used instead. But if the cloud detection fails, an artificially high AOT will be retrieved over clouds. If the high AOT is used to derive the surface reflectance of the neighboring cloud-free pixels, very low surface reflectance values will result. If the surface reflectance value of a pixel is below -0.2, a NO_DATA value of -9999 is used. \n\n* Unusually low reflectance around other bright land targets: While the HLS atmospheric correction retrieves AOT over non-cloud, non-snow bright pixels, the retrieved AOT over bright targets can be unrealistically high in some cases, similar to cloud or snow. If this unrealistically high AOT is used to derive the surface reflectance of the neighboring pixels, very low surface reflectance values can result as shown in Figure 2. If the surface reflectance value of a pixel is below -0.2, a NO_DATA value of -9999 is used. These types of bright targets are mostly man-made, such as buildings, parking lots, and roads.  \n\n* Dark plumes over water: The HLS atmospheric correction does not attempt aerosol retrieval over water. For water pixels, the AOT retrieved from the nearest land pixels is used to derive the surface reflectance, but if the retrieval is incorrect, e.g. from a cloud pixel, this high AOT will create dark stripes over water, as shown in Figure 3. This happens more often over large water bodies, such as lakes and bays, than over narrow rivers.  \n\n* Landsat WRS-2 Path/Row boundary in L30 reflectance: HLS performs atmospheric correction on Landsat Level 1 images in the original Worldwide Reference System 2 (WRS2) path/row before the derived surface reflectance is reprojected into Military Grid Reference System (MGRS) tiles. If a WRS-2 Landsat image is very cloudy, the AOT from a few remaining clear pixels might be used for the atmospheric correction of the entire image. The AOT that is used can be quite different from the value for the adjacent row in the same path, which results in an artificial abrupt change from one row to the next, as shown in Figure 4. This occurrence is very rare.  \n \n* Landsat WRS2 path/row boundary in cloud masks: The cloud mask algorithm Fmask creates mask labels by applying thresholds to the histograms of some metrics for each path/row independently. If two adjacent rows in the same path have distinct distributions within the metrics, abrupt changes in masking patterns can appear across the row boundary, as shown in Figure 5. This occurrence is very rare.  \n\n* Fmask configuration was deficient for 2-3 months in 2021: The HLS installation of Fmask failed to include auxiliary digital elevation model (DEM) and European Space Agency (ESA) Global Surface Water Occurrence data for a 2-3 month run in 2021. This impacted the masking results over water and in mountainous regions. \n\n* The reflectance “scale_factor” and “offset” for some L30 and S30 bands were not set: The HLS reflectance scaling factor is 0.0001 and offset is 0. However, this information was not set in the Cloud Optimized GeoTIFF (COG) files of some bands for a small number of granules. The lack of this information creates a problem for automatic conversion of the reflectance data, requiring explicit scaling in applications. The problem has been corrected, but the affected granules have not been reprocessed. \n\n* Incomplete map projection information: For a time, HLS imagery was produced with an incomplete coordinate reference system (CRS). The metadata contains the Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM) zone and coordinates necessary to geolocate pixels within the image but might not be in a standard form, especially for granules produced early in the HLS mission. As a result, an error will occur in certain image processing packages due to the incomplete CRS. The simplest solution is to update to the latest version of Geospatial Data Abstraction Library (GDAL) and/or rasterio, which use the available information without error. \n\n* False northing of 10^7 for the L30 angle data: The L30 and S30 products do not use a false northing for the UTM projection, and the angle data are supposed to follow the same convention. However, the L30 angle data incorrectly uses a false northing of 10^7. There is no problem with the angle data itself, but the false northing needs to be set to 0 for it to be aligned with the reflectance.\n\n* L30 from Landsat L1GT scenes: Landsat L1GT scenes were not intended for HLS due to their poor geolocation. However, some scenes made it through screening for a short period of HLS production. L1GT L30 scenes mainly consist of extensive cloud or snow that can be eliminated using the Fmask quality bits layer. Users can also identify an L1GT-originated L30 granule by examining the HLS cmr.xml metadata file.\n\n* The UTC dates in the L30/S30 filenames may not be the local dates: UTC dates are used by ESA and the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) in naming their Level 1 images, and HLS processing retains this information to name the L30 and S30 products. Landsat and Sentinel-2 overpass eastern Australia and New Zealand around 10AM local solar time, but this area is in either UTC+10:00 or +11:00 zone; therefore, the UTC time for some orbits is in fact near the end of the preceding UTC day. For example, HLS.S30.T59HQS.2016117T221552.v2.0 was acquired in the 22nd hour of day 117 of year 2016 in UTC, but the time was 10:15:52 of day 118 locally. Approximately 100 minutes later HLS.S30.T56JML.2016117T235252.v2.0 was acquired in the next orbit in eastern Australia. \n\n     This issue also occurs for Landsat. For example, HLS.L30.T59HQS.2016117T221209.v2.0 was acquired on the same day as the first S30 example given above, but both on day 118 of 2016 locally. Adding to the confusion for L30, in the same region, Landsat 8 and 9 can each overpass once in one of the two adjacent WRS-2 Paths (91/92/93) over a two-day period on a local calendar, but based on UTC time, the two overpasses can appear to be on the same day. For example, in the following seemingly same-day pair, the second L30 is actually for day 168 locally:  \n     HLS.L30.T55GCN.2023167T000407.v2.0  \n     HLS.L30.T55GCN.2023167T235747.v2.0  \n     Bear in mind, the date peculiarity for the data occurs when the overpass time is during the late hours of a UTC day. \n\n* The atmospheric ancillary data from the wrong date was used for LaSRC: Related to the above, for eastern Australia and New Zealand, L30 and S30 surface reflectance on certain days was created using the atmospheric ancillary data from a date that was one day too early. The exact geographic extent of the affected HLS products and the impact on the surface reflectance quality are under investigation. Practice caution when using data with overpass times during the late hours of a UTC day.\n\n* Duplicates in L30: The Landsat 9 acquisitions from October 2021 to March 2023 in Landsat Collection 2 were reprocessed by USGS in March 2023. This reprocessing updated the overpass time by a fraction of a second for some scenes. Since HLS uses overpass time as part of the L30 filename, the older L30 granules were not automatically overwritten due to the different filenames. For example, the first L30 granule in the following pair originated from an older version of L1TP of Landsat 9 with the second granule originating from the reprocessed version.    \nHLS.L30.T11SLC.2022166T182646.v2.0  \nHLS.L30.T11SLC.2022166T182645.v2.0  \nThere are other causes of duplicate L30 granules, but the overall number of duplicates is very small.\n\n* Poor Geolocation: A large amount of granules that were processed for May through July 2023 were created with L1GT input scenes which were deemed undesirable due to a poor geolocation issue. These granules were removed from the archive. (see the full list of removed [granules](https://lpdaac.usgs.gov/documents/2161/L30_L1GT_granules_May_July_2023.csv))\n\nImprovements/Changes from Previous Versions\n\n* Aerosol QA bits from the USGS Land Surface Reflectance Code (LaSRC) model output have been added into the Function of Mask (Fmask) data layer. The added two bits indicate the aerosol levels: high, medium, low, and climatology aerosol.\nRead our doc on how to get AWS Credentials to retrieve this data: https://data.lpdaac.earthdatacloud.nasa.gov/s3credentialsREADME",

These estimates are computed using the generalized least squares (GLS) estimator using as input the publicly available 2020 Census persons universe noisy measurement files for both [the Redistricting Data File](https://registry.opendata.aws/census-2020-pl94-nmf/) and [the Demographic and Housing Characteristics File](https://registry.opendata.aws/census-2020-dhc-nmf/). The algorithm used to compute this estimate is described in more detail in [Least Squares Estimation For Hierarchical Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13164). As described in more detail in this paper and the README below, the primary goal of this data product is to provide the data required to compute confidence intervals for the 2020 Census Redistricting Data File published counts that account for the uncertainty in these published counts due to the disclosure avoidance methods applied to 2020 Census tabulations. In other words, these confidence intervals do not account for other sources of error, such as those due to enumeration errors.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n",

    "Name": "NASA / USGS Controlled Europa DTMs",
    "Description": "Knowledge of a planetary surface’s topography is necessary to understand its geology and enable landed mission operations. The Solid State Imager (SSI) on board NASA’s Galileo spacecraft acquired more than 700 images of Jupiter’s moon Europa. Although moderate- and high-resolution coverage is extremely limited, repeat coverage of a small number of sites enables the creation of digital terrain models (DTMs) via stereophotogrammetry. Here we provide stereo-derived DTMs of five sites on Europa. The sites are the bright band Agenor Linea, the crater Cilix, the crater Pwyll, pits and chaos adjacent to Rhadamanthys Linea, and ridged plains near Yelland Linea. We generated the DTMs using BAE’s SOCET SET® software and each was manually edited to correct identifiable errors from the automated stereo matching process. Additionally, we used the recently updated image pointing information provided by the U.S. Geological Survey (Bland, et al., 2021), which ties the DTMs to an existing horizontal datum and enables the DTMs to easily be used in coordination with that globally controlled image set. The DTMs are of the highest quality achievable with Galileo data and are therefore suitable for most scientific analysis. However, there are inherent uncertainties in the DTMs including horizontal resolutions that are typically 1–2 km (~10x the image pixel scale) and expected vertical precision (the root mean square (RMS) uncertainty in a point elevation) of 10s–100s of m. The DTMs and their uncertainties are discussed in detail in the documentation.\n",

    "Description": "WARNING: On 2021/09/23 the EOS Aqua executed a Deep Space Maneuver (DSM). In the DSM, the spacecraft is turned such that the normal Earth field of regard is deep space.\n\nThe thermal impact of the DSM caused a shift of the centroids of spectral response functions (SRF) of about 1% of the width of the SRF, equivalent to a frequency shift of 9 parts per million. This shift is reflected in the “spectral_freq” parameter (observed frequencies) in the L1b v5 files for each 6 minute granule. The magnitude of the effect on brightness temperatures (BT) depends on the spectral gradient of each channel. Maximum BT shifts are approximately +- 0.5 K, although many channels experience far smaller BT shifts. Approximately 1803 channels have BT shifts of less than 0.1 K and 575 channels are now shifted in BT by more than 0.1 K, while 231 of these channels have BT shifts greater than 0.2 K.\n\nUsers of the L1b v5 product who are concerned that these shifts may impact their science investigations and applications are encouraged to switch to the AIRS L1c v6.7.4 product, which, among many other improvements, converts the spectra to a fixed frequency grid.          END OF WARNING.\n\nThe Atmospheric Infrared Sounder (AIRS) is a grating spectrometer (R = 1200) aboard the second Earth Observing System (EOS) polar-orbiting platform, EOS Aqua. In combination with the Advanced Microwave Sounding Unit (AMSU) and the Humidity Sounder for Brazil (HSB), AIRS constitutes an innovative atmospheric sounding group of visible, infrared, and microwave sensors. The AIRS Infrared (IR) level 1B data set contains AIRS calibrated and geolocated radiances in milliWatts/m^2/cm^-1/steradian for 2378 infrared channels in the 3.74 to 15.4 micron region of t he spectrum. The AIRS instrument is co-aligned with AMSU-A so that successive blocks of 3 x 3 AIRS footprints are contained within one AMSU-A footprint. The AIRIBRAD_005 products are stored in files (often referred to as \"granules\") that contain 6 minutes of data, 90 footprints across track by 135 lines along track.\nRead our doc on how to get AWS Credentials to retrieve this data: https://data.gesdisc.earthdata.nasa.gov/s3credentialsREADME",

Underlying forecast and data assimilation systems are based on the UFS model prototype version-6 and the Next Generation Global Ocean Data Assimilation System (NG-GODAS) release of the Joint Effort for Data assimilation Integration (JEDI) Sea Ice Ocean Coupled Assimilation (SOCA). Covering the 40 year reanalysis time period from 1979 to 2019, the data atmosphere option of the UFS coupled global atmosphere ocean sea ice (DATM-MOM6-CICE6) model was applied with two atmospheric forcing data sets: CFSR from 1979 to 1999 and GEFS from 2000 to 2019. Assimilated observation data sets include extensive space-based marine observations and conventional direct measurements of in situ profile data sets.\n<br/><br/>\nThis first UFS-marine interim reanalysis product is released to the broader weather and earth system modeling and analysis communities to obtain scientific feedback and applications for the development of the next generation operational numerical weather prediction system at the National Weather Service(NWS). The released file sets include two parts 1.) 1979 - 2019 UFS-DATM-MOM6-CICE6 model free runs and 2) 1979-2019 reanalysis cycle outputs (see descriptions embedded in each file set). Analyzed sea ice and ocean variables are ocean temperature, salinity, sea surface height, and sea ice concentration.\n<br/><br/>\nAcknowledgment - The UFS data assimilation and reanalysis and reforecast products produced from the UFS-R2O project are sponsored by the NWS Office of Science and Technology Integration (OSTI) Modeling Program Division and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s(NOAA) Oceanic and Atmospheric Research (OAR) Weather Program Office (WPO).\n",

    "Description": "The Solid State Imager (SSI) on NASA's Galileo spacecraft acquired more than 500 images of Jupiter's moon, Europa. These images vary from relatively low-resolution hemispherical imaging, to high-resolution targeted images that cover a small portion of the surface. Here we provide a set of 481 minimally processed, projected Galileo images with photogrammetrically improved locations on Europa's surface. These individual images were subsequently used as input into a set of 92 observation mosaics. <br/><br/>\nThese images provide users with nearly the entire Galileo Europa imaging dataset at its native resolution and with improved relative image locations. The Solid State Imager on NASA's Galileo spacecraft provided the only moderate- to high-resolution images of Jupiter's moon, Europa. Unfortunately, uncertainty in the position and pointing of the spacecraft, as well as the position and orientation of Europa, when the images were acquired resulted in significant errors in image locations on the surface. The result of these errors is that images acquired during different Galileo orbits, or even at different times during the same orbit, are significantly misaligned (errors of up to 100 km on the surface). <br/><br/>\nThe dataset provides a set of individual images that can be used for scientific analysis and mission planning activities.\n",

According to reports, 14 people have died in Karongi, 26 in Rutsiro, 18 in Rubavu, 19 in Nyabihu and 18 in Ngororero.Rwanda National Police reported that the Mukamira-Ngororero and Rubavu-Rutsiro roads are impassable due to flooding and landslide debris. UNITAR on behalf of United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) / Regional Office for Southern & Eastern Africa in cooperation with Rwanda Space Agency (RSA) was activated International Disaster Charter. JAXA has responded to the flood event in Rwanda by conducting emergency disaster observations and providing data as requested by OCHA and RSA through the International Disaster Charter. The 25 m PALSAR-2 ScanSAR is normalized backscatter data of PALSAR-2 broad area observation mode with observation width of 350 km. Polarization data are stored as 16-bit digital numbers (DN). The DN values can be converted to gamma naught values in decibel unit (dB) using the following equation sigma zero = 10*log10(DN2) - 83.0 dB. Included in this dataset are ALOS-2 PALSAR-2 ScanSAR 2.1 data. Level 2.1 data is orthorectified from level 1.1 data by using digital elevation model.

    "Description": "The Global Ecosystem Dynamics Investigation ([GEDI](https://gedi.umd.edu/)) mission aims to characterize ecosystem structure and dynamics to enable radically improved quantification and understanding of the Earth’s carbon cycle and biodiversity. The GEDI instrument produces high resolution laser ranging observations of the 3-dimensional structure of the Earth. GEDI is attached to the International Space Station (ISS) and collects data globally between 51.6° N and 51.6° S latitudes at the highest resolution and densest sampling of any light detection and ranging (lidar) instrument in orbit to date. Each GEDI Version 2 granule encompasses one-fourth of an ISS orbit and includes georeferenced metadata to allow for spatial querying and subsetting.\n\nThe GEDI instrument was removed from the ISS and placed into storage on March 17, 2023. No data were acquired during the hibernation period from March 17, 2023, to April 24, 2024. GEDI has since been reinstalled on the ISS and resumed operations as of April 26, 2024.\n\nThe purpose of the GEDI Level 2A Geolocated Elevation and Height Metrics product (GEDI02_A) is to provide waveform interpretation and extracted products from each GEDI01_B received waveform, including ground elevation, canopy top height, and relative height (RH) metrics. The methodology for generating the GEDI02_A product datasets is adapted from the Land, Vegetation, and Ice Sensor (LVIS) algorithm. The GEDI02_A product is provided in HDF5 format and has a spatial resolution (average footprint) of 25 meters.\n\nThe GEDI02_A data product contains 156 layers for each of the eight beams, including ground elevation, canopy top height, relative return energy metrics (e.g., canopy vertical structure), and many other interpreted products from the return waveforms. Additional information for the layers can be found in the GEDI Level 2A Dictionary.\n\nKnown Issues\n\n* Data acquisition gaps: GEDI data acquisitions were suspended on December 19, 2019 (2019 Day 353) and resumed on January 8, 2020 (2020 Day 8).\n* Incorrect Reference Ground Track (RGT) number in the filename for select GEDI files: GEDI Science Data Products for six orbits on August 7, 2020, and November 12, 2021, had the incorrect RGT number in the filename. There is no impact to the science data, but users should reference this [document](https://lpdaac.usgs.gov/documents/2236/GEDI_CORRECTED_RGT_FILENAMES.pptx) for the correct RGT numbers.\n* Known Issues: Section 8 of the User Guide provides additional information on known issues.\n\nImprovements/Changes from Previous Versions\n\n* Metadata has been updated to include spatial coordinates.\n* Granule size has been reduced from one full ISS orbit (~5.83 GB) to four segments per orbit (~1.48 GB).\n* Filename has been updated to include segment number and version number.\n* Improved geolocation for an orbital segment.\n* Added elevation from the SRTM digital elevation model for comparison.\n* Modified the method to predict an optimum algorithm setting group per laser shot.\n* Added additional land cover datasets related to phenology, urban infrastructure, and water persistence.\n* Added selected_mode_flag dataset to root beam group using selected algorithm.\n* Removed shots when the laser is not firing.\n* Modified file name to include segment number and dataset version.\nRead our doc on how to get AWS Credentials to retrieve this data: https://data.lpdaac.earthdatacloud.nasa.gov/s3credentialsREADME",

    "Description": "The FourCastNet Global Forecast System (FourCastNetGFS) is an experimental system set up by the National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) to produce medium range global forecasts. The model runs on a 0.25 degree latitude-longitude grid (about 28 km) and 13 pressure levels. The model produces forecasts 4 times a day at 00Z, 06Z, 12Z and 18Z cycles. Major atmospheric and surface fields including temperature, wind components, geopotential height, relative humidity and 2 meter temperature and 10 meter winds are available. The products are 6 hourly forecasts up to 10 days. The data format is GRIB2.\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThe FourCastNetGFS system is an experimental weather forecast model built upon the pre-trained Nvidia’s FourCastNet Machine Learning Weather Prediction (MLWP) model version 2. The FourCastNet (Bonev et al, 2023) was developed by Nvidia using Adaptive Fourier Neural Operators. It uses a Fourier transform-based token-mixing scheme with the vision transformer architecture. This model is pre-trained with ECMWF’s ERA5 reanalysis data. The FourCastNetGFS takes one model state as initial condition from NCEP 0.25 degree GDAS analysis data and runs FourCastNet with weights from the pretrained FourCastNet by Nvidia. Unit conversion to the GDAS data is conducted to match the input data required by FourCastNet and to generate forecast products consistent to GFS.\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThe input data generated from the GDAS data as FourCastNet input is provided under the forecast data directory. Example of file names is:\n<br/>\n<br/>\ninput_2024022000.npy\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are 40 files under each directory covering a 10 day forecast. An example of file name is listed below\n<br/>\n<br/>\nfcngfs.t00z.pgrb2.0p25.f006\n<br/>\n<br/>\nPlease note that this NOAA GFS machine learning Model was produced using a code package released by ECMWF’s ai_models_fourcastnetv2 plugin. For information on ai_models_fourcastnetv2 plugin, please visit their github page listed in the documentation and license sections of this page.\n",

In this area the LC generates several eddies which control the larval species and the higher marine species and ecosystems in which they forage.\n\nThe CORL HF ocean radar system consists of two SeaSonde crossed loop direction finding stations located at Dongara (29.283 S 114.920E) and Green Head (114.967 E 30.073 S).  These radars operate at a frequency of 4.463 MHz, with a bandwidth of 25 KHz, a maximum range of 200 Km and a range resolution of 6 Km.  Within the HF radar coverage area surface currents are measured.\n\nThe CORL area of coverage has a small overlap of commonly observed ocean with the Turqoise Coast (TURQ) SeaSonde HF ocean radar system on its southern side, which in turns early overlaps with the Rottnest HF radar node.  Together, the CORL, TURQ and ROT systems provide continuous monitoring of the shelf from Fremantle to Geraldton.",

    "Description": "Over 1.5 million spine fractures occur annually in the United States alone resulting in over 17,730 spinal cord injuries annually. The most common site of spine fracture is the cervical spine. There has been a rise in the incidence of spinal fractures in the elderly and in this population, fractures can be more difficult to detect on imaging due to degenerative disease and osteoporosis. Imaging diagnosis of adult spine fractures is now almost exclusively performed with computed tomography (CT). Quickly detecting and determining the location of any vertebral fractures is essential to prevent neurologic deterioration and paralysis after trauma. RSNA has teamed with the American Society of Neuroradiology (ASNR) and the American Society of Spine Radiology (ASSR) to create this ground truth dataset, collecting imaging data from twelve sites on six continents, including approximately 2,000 CT studies. Spine radiology specialists from the ASNR and ASSR provided expert image level annotations these studies to indicate the presence, vertebral level and location of any cervical spine fractures.",

    "Description": "This dataset contains Level-3 Dynamic OPERA surface water extent product version 1.  The data are validated surface water extent observations beginning April 2023. Known issues and caveats on usage are described under Documentation. The input dataset for generating each product is the Harmonized Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2A/B/C (HLS) product version 2.0. HLS products provide surface reflectance (SR) data from the Operational Land Imager (OLI) aboard the Landsat 8 satellite and the MultiSpectral Instrument (MSI) aboard the Sentinel-2A/B/C satellite. The surface water extent products are distributed over projected map coordinates using the Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM) projection. Each UTM tile covers an area of 109.8 km × 109.8 km. This area is divided into 3,660 rows and 3,660 columns at 30-m pixel spacing. Each product is distributed as a set of 10 GeoTIFF (Geographic Tagged Image File Format) files including water classification, associated confidence, land cover classification, terrain shadow layer, cloud/cloud-shadow classification, Digital elevation model (DEM), and Diagnostic layer.\n<br><br>\nThe digital elevation model (DEM) provided as a layer of the DSWx-HLS product (band 10) was generated using the Copernicus DEM 30-m and Copernicus DEM 90-m models provided by the European Space Agency. The Copernicus DEM 30-m and Copernicus DEM 90-m were produced using Copernicus WorldDEM-30 © DLR e.V. 2010-2014 and © Airbus Defence and Space GmbH 2014-2018 provided under COPERNICUS by the European Union and ESA; all rights reserved.

    "Description": "The Observational Products for End-Users from Remote Sensing Analysis ([OPERA](https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/go/opera)) Land Surface Disturbance Alert from Harmonized Landsat Sentinel-2 (HLS) product Version 1 maps vegetation disturbance alerts that are derived from data collected by Landsat 8 and Landsat 9 Operational Land Imager (OLI) and Sentinel-2A, Sentinel-2B, and Sentinel-2C Multi-Spectral Instrument (MSI). A vegetation disturbance alert is detected at 30 meter (m) spatial resolution when there is an indicated decrease in vegetation cover within an HLS pixel. The Level-3 data product also provides additional information about more general disturbance trends and auxiliary generic disturbance information as determined from the variations of the reflectance through the HLS scenes. [HLS](https://lpdaac.usgs.gov/product_search/?collections=HLS&status=Operational&view=list) data represent the highest temporal frequency data available at medium spatial resolution. The combined observations will provide greater sensitivity to land changes, whether of large magnitude/short duration or small magnitude/long duration.\n\nThe OPERA_L3_DIST-ALERT-HLS (or DIST-ALERT) data product is provided in Cloud Optimized GeoTIFF (COG) format, and each layer is distributed as a separate file. There are 19 layers contained within the DIST-ALERT product. The layers for both vegetation and generic disturbance include disturbance status, loss or anomaly, maximum loss anomaly, disturbance confidence layer, date of disturbance, count of observations with loss anomalies, days of ongoing anomalies, and day of last disturbance detection. Additional layers are vegetation cover percent, historical percent vegetation cover, and data mask. See the Product Specification Document (PSD) for a more detailed description of the individual layers provided in the DIST-ALERT product.\n\nThe OPERA_L3_DIST-ALERT-HLS product contains modified Copernicus Sentinel data (2020-2025).\n\nKnown Issues\n* Additional usage constraints are provided under Section 5 of the Algorithm Theoretical Basis Document (ATBD).\nRead our doc on how to get AWS Credentials to retrieve this data: https://data.lpdaac.earthdatacloud.nasa.gov/s3credentialsREADME",

Sentinel-2 consists of twin satellites, Sentinel-2A (launched 23 June 2015) and Sentinel-2B (launched 7 March 2017). The two satellites have the same orbit, but 180° apart for optimal coverage and data delivery. Their combined data is used in the Digital Earth Africa Sentinel-2 product.\nTogether, they cover all Earth’s land surfaces, large islands, inland and coastal waters every 3-5 days.\nSentinel-2 data is tiered by level of pre-processing. Level-0, Level-1A and Level-1B data contain raw data from the satellites, with little to no pre-processing. Level-1C data is surface reflectance measured at the top of the atmosphere. This is processed using the Sen2Cor algorithm to give Level-2A, the bottom-of-atmosphere reflectance (Obregón et al, 2019). Level-2A data is the most ideal for research activities as it allows further analysis without applying additional atmospheric corrections.\nThe Digital Earth Africa Sentinel-2 dataset contains Level-2A data of the African continent. Digital Earth Africa does not host any lower-level Sentinel-2 data.\nNote that this data is a subset of the Sentinel-2 COGs dataset.\n",

    "Description": "This is a regional GHRSST level 3 collated (L3C) dataset on 0.02-degree rectangular grid over the Australasian domain (70E to 190E, 70S to 20N) based on retrievals from the AHI imager on board Himawari-8 satellite. The Bureau of Meteorology (Bureau) produces Integrated Marine Observing System (IMOS) satellite SST products in the International Group for High Resolution SST (GHRSST) GDS2 file formats for Himawari-8 in real time and delayed mode. This product is composed of reprocessed multi-swath SSTskin retrievals obtained from compositing IMOS Himawari-8 hourly L3C files over the night (before dawn).  \nEvery 10 minutes, the Himawari-8 full disk is processed to retrieve SSTs by using the Radiative Transfer Model (RTTOV12.3) and Bayesian cloud clearing method based on the ESA CCI SST code developed at the University of Reading. The hourly product on native grid is then produced by compositing over multiple swaths for the previous 1 hour. Further, L3C-01day SST fields on native grid are obtained by selecting the highest quality data from the hourly SST records with priority being given to the value the closest in time to the product nominal hour.  The L3C-1day night product on native grid is then remapped over the 0.02-degree IMOS grid to compose IMOS L3C-1day night product (Govekar et al., 2021,  https://www.foo.org.au/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Govekar_FOO_2021.pdf).   The product format is compliant with the GHRSST Data Specification (GDS) version 2.",

    "Name": "Ocean Radar - Turquoise coast site - Sea water velocity - Delayed mode",
    "Description": "The Turquoise Coast (TURQ) HF ocean radar system covers the area of shelf between Seabird and Jurien Bay and is the logical continuation of major research efforts to understand the role of the Leeuwin Current System (Leeuwin Current, the Leeuwin Undercurrent and Capes Current) in controlling not only the physical system but also its links to both pelagic and benthic ecosystems.  In contrast to eastern ocean basins, which are highly productive, Western Australia experiences an oligotrophic environment. The Leeuwin Current is a shallow (<300 m deep), narrow band (< 100 km wide) of warm, lower salinity, nutrient depleted water of tropical origin that flows poleward from Exmouth to Cape Leeuwin and into the Great Australian Bight.  The Current plays a dominant role in controlling the marine life and climate of the region.  \n\nQuestions which may be addressed by using the HF ocean radar data from TURQ (and ROT) include the variability of the Leeuwin current and its response to the ENSO cycle;  Leeuwin Current eddies and their interaction with the shelf waters; and the interaction between the Leeuwin Current, the Capes Current and coastal current during the summer.  This is an important region for Western Rock lobster recruitment, and the meanders of the warm Leeuwin Current influence the ecology.  This is a region with low tidal range and with a coastline subject to strong sea breezes and intense winter storms.  Coastally trapped waves may be generated by the winter weather systems and by tropical cyclones in the summer.  \n\nThe TURQ HF ocean radar system consists of two SeaSonde crossed loop direction finding stations located at Seabird (31.281 S 115.444 E) and Cervantes (30.506 S  115.060E). From 2012-12-15T11:00:00 the Cervantes station has been replaced by the Green Head station (30.073 S 114.967E) and from 2013-03-19T00:00:00 the Seabird station has been replaced by the Lancelin station (31.027 S 115.328 E). These radars operate at a frequency of 5.211 MHz, with a bandwidth of 50 KHz, a maximum range of 200 Km\nand a range resolution of 3 Km.  Within the HF radar coverage area surface currents are measured.\n\nThe TURQ area of coverage has a small overlap of commonly observed ocean with the Rottnest Shelf (ROT) WERA HF ocean radar system on its south side.

    "Name": "NOAA / NGA Satellite Computed Bathymetry Assessment-SCuBA",
    "Description": "One of the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency’s (NGA) and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s (NOAA) missions is to ensure the safety of navigation on the seas by \nmaintaining the most current information and the highest quality services for U.S. and global transport networks. To achieve this mission, we need accurate coastal bathymetry over diverse \nenvironmental conditions. The SCuBA program focused on providing critical information to improve existing bathymetry resources and techniques with two specific objectives. The first objective \nwas to validate National Aeronautics and Space Administration’s (NASA) Ice, Cloud and land Elevation SATellite-2 (ICESat-2), an Earth observing, space-based light detection and ranging (LiDAR) \ncapability, as a useful bathymetry tool for nearshore bathymetry information in differing environmental conditions. Upon validating the ICESat-2 bathymetry retrievals relative to sea floor \ntype, water clarity, and water surface dynamics, the next objective is to use ICESat-2 as a calibration tool to improve existing Satellite Derived Bathymetry (SDB) coastal bathymetry products \nwith poor coastal depth information but superior spatial coverage. Current resources that monitor coastal bathymetry can have large vertical depth errors (up to 50 percent) in the nearshore \nregion; however, derived results from ICESat-2 shows promising results for improving the accuracy of the bathymetry information in the nearshore region.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n**Project Overview**\n<br/>\nOne of NGA’s and NOAA’s primary missions is to provide safety of navigation information.  However, coastal depth information is still lacking in some regions—specifically, remote regions. In fact, it has been reported that 80 percent of the entire seafloor has not been mapped. Traditionally, airborne LiDARs and survey boats are used to map the seafloor, but in remote areas, we have to rely on satellite capabilities, which currently lack the vertical accuracy desired to support safety of navigation in shallow water. In 2018, NASA launched a space-based LiDAR system called ICESat-2 that has global coverage and a polar orbit originally designed to monitor the ice elevation in polar regions. Remarkably, because it has a green laser beam, ICESat-2 also happens to collect bathymetry information [ICESat-2](nasa.gov). With algorithm development provided by University of Texas (UT) Austin, NGA Research and Development (R&D) leveraged the ICESat-2 platform to generate SCuBA, an automated depth retrieval algorithm for accurate, global, refraction-corrected underwater depths from 0 m to 30 m, detailed in Figure 1 of the documentation. The key benefit of this product is the vertical depth accuracy of depth retrievals, which is ideal for a calibration tool.  NGA and NOAA National Geodetic Survey (NGS), partnered to make this product available to the public for all US territories.\n[View the SCuBA Info Graphic](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NOAA-Big-Data-Program/bdp-data-docs/main/SCuBA/SCuBA_Infographic_small.png)\n<br/>\nAll details on how SCuBA was developed, how to access data, and how to use the data, please visit the [DOCUMENTATION](https://github.com/NOAA-Big-Data-Program/bdp-data-docs/blob/main/SCuBA/NOAA_website_SCUBA_22MAY24_GOLD.docx.pdf) page. \n",

The SEA-AD datasets available here comprise single cell profiling (transcriptomics and epigenomics) and quantitative neuropathology. To explore gene expression and chromatin accessibility information, the single-cell profiling data includes: snRNAseq and snATAC-seq data from the SEA-AD donor cohort (aged brains which span the spectrum of Alzheimer's Disease pathology) and neurotypical reference brains. To explore key pathological proteins and cell types of interest to Alzheimer's disease, the neuropathology data includes: full resolution brightfield images, images processed and segmented in HALO image analysis software, image annotations, and quantification summary files for the relevant stains including Abeta (6E10), IBA1, a-Synuclein, GFAP, H&E-LFB, NeuN, pTau(AT8), and pTDP43.\n",

    "Description": "Enhancement of Measurements on Ships of Opportunity (SOOP)-Air Sea Flux sub-facility collects underway meteorological and oceanographic observations during scientific and Antarctic resupply voyages in the oceans adjacent to Australia. Data product is quality controlled observations. Research Vessel Real Time Air-Sea Fluxes, equips the Marine National Facility (MNF) (Research Vessels Southern Surveyor and Investigator), the Australian Antarctic Division (Research and Supply Vessels Aurora Australis and Nuyina), and Research Vessel Tangaroa with \"climate quality\" meteorological measurement systems, capable of providing high quality air-sea flux measurements and delivered to researchers on a near real-time basis. Obtaining the full set of air-sea fluxes essential for climate studies requires observations of: wind, air and sea temperature, humidity, pressure, precipitation, long- and short-wave radiation. The existing ship meteorological sensor sets are completed with IMOS instruments and a comprehensive annual calibration program implemented. Data streams are fed into existing ship data management systems, and broadcast via satellite back to Australia routinely. The observations are quality controlled at the Bureau of Meteorology. A daily file of 1-minute averages of the observations are generated shortly after 0000UTC and provided to IMOS.",

    "Description": "The KyFromAbove initiative is focused on building and maintaining a current basemap for Kentucky that can meet the needs of its users at the state, federal, local, and regional level. A common basemap, including current color leaf-off aerial photography and elevation data (LiDAR), reduces the cost of developing GIS applications, promotes data sharing, and add efficiencies to many business processes. All basemap data acquired through this effort is being made available in the public domain. KyFromAbove acquires aerial imagery and LiDAR during leaf-off conditions in the Commonwealth. The imagery typically ranges from 6-inches to 3-inches in resolution and is available from the kyfromabove Amazon S3 bucket in a Cloud Optimized GeoTiff format. LiDAR data acquired by the program is USGS Quality Level 2 (QL2). Digital Elevation Models (DEMs) at a 2-foot resolution, point cloud data in an LAS format, spot elevations in a geopackage format, and contours in a geopackage format are also available from the kyfromabove Amazon S3 bucket. KyFromAbove LiDAR and imagery data resources are managed in a Kentucky-specific 5000x5000 foot grid (FIPS:1600) (EPSG:3089). More details about the program can be found at (https://kyfromabove.ky.gov/)",

    "UpdateFrequency": "KyFromAbove data are typically updated on an annual basis. Each year, a portion of the state is acquired with an overall update cycle of every three to four years. This update cadance is determined by both funding and the length of leaf-off conditions in a given year.

    "Description": "The Solid State Imager (SSI) on NASA's Galileo spacecraft acquired more than 500 images of Jupiter's moon, Europa. These images vary from relatively low-resolution hemispherical imaging, to high-resolution targeted images that cover a small portion of the surface. Here we provide a set of 92 image mosaics generated from minimally processed, projected Galileo images with photogrammetrically improved locations on Europa's surface.<br/><br/>\nThese images provide users with nearly the entire Galileo Europa imaging dataset at its native resolution and with improved relative image locations. The Solid State Imager on NASA's Galileo spacecraft provided the only moderate- to high-resolution images of Jupiter's moon, Europa. Unfortunately, uncertainty in the position and pointing of the spacecraft, as well as the position and orientation of Europa, when the images were acquired resulted in significant errors in image locations on the surface. The result of these errors is that images acquired during different Galileo orbits, or even at different times during the same orbit, are significantly misaligned (errors of up to 100 km on the surface). <br/><br/>\nThe dataset provides a set of individual images that can be used for scientific analysis and mission planning activities.\n",

Note: since the overviews are generated by downsampling the data from the zoom level above, care should be taken to use data from the native resolution for most analysis purposes.\nThe NEX-GDDP-CMIP-COG archive was generated by re-processing a subset of the NEX-GDDP-CMIP6 archive from NetCDF into COGs. The subset contains 2 models: GFDL-CM4 and GISS-E2-1-G and 2 SSPs for each model: ssp245 and ssp585.\nThe data is divided into 3 sub-products: daily, monthly, crossing. \n  - daily: source data with daily timestamps.\n  - monthly: monthly aggregatations across both models, currently displayed in the https://cmip6.surge.sh/ dashboard. The reduced temporal granularity makes this sub-product a good choice for interactive dashboards. \n  - crossing: a single data product for each ssp, that indicates the number of years until the average daily temperature is expected to pass the 2 degree limit from the Paris Agreement, at each position on earth.\n",

    "Description": "The coupled Whole Atmosphere Model-Ionosphere Plasmasphere Electrodynamics (WAM-IPE) Forecast System (WFS) is developed and maintained by the NOAA Space Weather Prediction Center (SWPC). The WAM-IPE model provides a specification of ionosphere and thermosphere conditions with real-time nowcasts and forecasts up to two days in advance in response to solar, geomagnetic, and lower atmospheric forcing. The WAM is an extension of the Global Forecast System (GFS) with a spectral hydrostatic dynamical core utilizing an enthalpy thermodynamic variable to 150 vertical levels on a hybrid pressure-sigma grid, with a model top of approximately 3 x 10-7 Pa (typically 400-600km depending on levels of solar activity). Additional upper atmospheric physics and chemistry, including electrodynamics and plasma processes, are included. The IPE model provides the plasma component of the atmosphere. It is a time-dependent, global 3D model of the ionosphere and plasmasphere from 90 km to approximately 10,000 km. WAM fields of winds, temperature, and molecular and atomic atmospheric composition are coupled to IPE to enable the plasma to respond to changes driven by the neutral atmosphere. <br/> <br/>\nThe operational WAM-IPE is currently running in two different Concepts of Operation (CONOPS) to produce results of Nowcast and Forecast. The WAM-IPE real-time nowcast system (WRS) ingests real-time solar wind parameters every 5 minutes from NOAA’s spacecrafts located at Lagrange point 1 (L1) between the Sun and Earth in order to capture rapid changes in the ionosphere and thermosphere due to the sudden onset of geomagnetic storms. The nowcast is reinitialized every six hours to include the latest forcing from the lower atmosphere. The forecast system (WFS) runs four times daily (0, 6, 12, 18 UT), providing two-day forecasts. Observed solar wind parameters are used whenever observational values are available, for the forecast portion, the forecasted 3-hour Kp and daily F10.7 issued by SWFO are ingested into the model to estimate solar wind parameters. Lower atmospheric data assimilation only carries out twice daily at 0 and 12 UT cycles to maintain the stability of the coupled model. Model version v1.2 became available in July 2023, featuring the implementation of the WRS into operations, as well as improvements to the Kp-derived solar wind parameters utilized by WFS forecasts. <br/> <br/> The data files within this bucket are provided strictly on a non-operational basis, with no guarantee of timely delivery or availability. There may exist temporal gaps in coverage. <br/> <br/> The top-level versioned directories (v1.x) include NetCDF files from operational runs providing 3-dimensional gridded neutral density every 10 minutes with an altitude range from 100 to 1000 km. wfs.YYYYMMDD subdirectories contain two-day forecasts, updated four times daily (cycle initialization 00, 06, 12, 18 UT). wrs.YYYYMMDD subdirectories contain real-time nowcast neutral density outputs, reinitialized every six hours up to the most current UT time. <br/> <br/> Additionally, model outputs intended exclusively for research purposes are contained in the top-level NON-OPERATIONAL_RESEARCH directory. Please contact the WAM-IPE team (contact information available below) before accessing such files. <br/> <br/>",

    "Description": "The Sentinel-2 mission is part of the European Union Copernicus programme for Earth observations. Sentinel-2 consists of twin satellites, Sentinel-2A (launched 23 June 2015) and Sentinel-2B (launched 7 March 2017). The two satellites have the same orbit, but 180° apart for optimal coverage and data delivery. Their combined data is used in the Digital Earth Africa Sentinel-2 product.\nTogether, they cover all Earth’s land surfaces, large islands, inland and coastal waters every 3-5 days.\nSentinel-2 data is tiered by level of pre-processing. Level-0, Level-1A and Level-1B data contain raw data from the satellites, with little to no pre-processing. Level-1C data is surface reflectance measured at the top of the atmosphere. This is processed using the Sen2Cor algorithm to give Level-2A, the bottom-of-atmosphere reflectance (Obregón et al, 2019). Level-2A data is the most ideal for research activities as it allows further analysis without applying additional atmospheric corrections.\nDigital Earth Africa Sentinel-2 Level-2A Surface Reflectance Collection 1 is the Sentinel-2 product processed for enhanced calibration and consistent time series between Sentinel-2A and Sentinel-2B. Digital Earth Africa does not host any lower-level Sentinel-2 data.\n\n\nNote that this data is a subset of the Sentinel-2 COGs dataset.\n",

This Regional Australian Multi-Sensor SST Analysis (RAMSSA) v1.0 system blends infra-red SST observations from the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) on NOAA and METOP polar-orbiting satellites, microwave SST observations from the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer-2 (AMSR-2) on GCOM-W, and in situ data from ships, and drifting and moored buoys from the Global Telecommunications System (GTS).  \n\nAll SST observations are filtered for those values suspected to be affected by diurnal warming by excluding cases which have experienced recent surface wind speeds of below 6 m/s during the day and less than 2 m/s during the night, thereby resulting in daily foundation SST estimates that are largely free of diurnal warming effects.",

As part of a collaborative analysis across the thirteen UKB-PPP partners, we conducted comprehensive protein quantitative trait loci (pQTL) mapping of 2,923 proteins that identifies 14,287 primary genetic associations, of which 85% are newly discovered, in addition to ancestry-specific pQTL mapping in non-Europeans. We identify independent secondary associations in 87% of cis and 30% of trans loci, expanding the catalogue of genetic instruments for downstream analyses.",

SWPC produces forecasts for multiple space weather phenomenon types and the resulting impacts to Earth and human activities.  A variety of products are available that provide these forecast expectations, and their respective measurements, in formats that range from detailed technical forecast discussions to NOAA Scale values to simple bulletins that give information in laymen's terms. Forecasting is the prediction of future events, based on analysis and modeling of the past and present conditions of the environment you are interested in. In Space Weather, persistence and recurrence of active regions on the sun over the 27-day solar rotational period play an important role in accurately forecasting the space environment.\n",

        "Description": "Using nanopore sequencing, researchers have directly identified DNA and RNA base modifications at nucleotide resolution, including 5-methylycytosine, 5-hydroxymethylcytosine, N6-methyladenosine, 5-bromodeoxyuridine in DAN; and N6-methyladenosine in RNA, with detection of other natural or synthetic epigenetic modifications possible through training basecalling algorithms. One of the most widespread genomic modifications is 5-methylcytosine (5mC), which most frequently occurs at  dinucleotides. Compared to whole-genome bisulfite sequencing, the traditional method of 5mC detection, nanopore technology can offer many advantages\nThe following cell lines/DNA samples were obtained from the NIGMS Human Genetic Cell Repository at the Coriell Institute for Medical Research: GM24385.\n",

        "Description": "CpG dinucleotides frequently occur in high-density clusters called CpG islands (CGI) and >60% of human genes have their promoters embedded within CGIs. Determining the methylation status of cytosines within CpGs is of substantial biological interest: alterations in methylation patterns within promoters is associated with changes in gene expression and disease states such as cancer. Exploring methylation differences between tumour samples and normal samples can help to elucidate mechanisms associated with tumour formation and development. Nanopore sequencing enables direct detection of methylated cytosines (e.g. at CpG sites), without the need for bisulfite conversion.\nOxford Nanopore’s Adaptive Sampling offers a flexible method to enrich regions of interest (e.g. CGIs) by depleting off-target regions during the sequencing run itself with no upfront sample manipulation. Here we introduce Reduced Representation Methylation Sequencing (RRMS) to target 310 Mb of the human genome including regions which are highly enriched for CpGs including ~28,000 CpG islands, ~50,600 shores and ~42,700 shelves as well as ~21,600 promoter regions.\n",

During HiRISE acquisition, the Context Camera (CTX) also collects lower resolution, higher spatial extent context images. These CTX acquisitions are also targeted stereopairs. This data set contains targeted CTX DTMs and orthoimages, created using the NASA Ames Stereopipeline. These data have been created using relatively controlled CTX images that have been globally bundle adjusted using the USGS Integrated System for Imagers and Spectrometers (ISIS) jigsaw application. Relative control at global scale reduces common issues such as spacecraft jitter in the resulting DTMs. DTMs were aligned as part of 26 different groupings to the ultimate MOLA product using an iterative pc_align approach. Therefore, all DTMs and orthoimages are absolutely controlled to MOLA, a proxy product for the Mars geodetic coordinate reference frame.\n",

    "Name": "Ocean Radar - Coffs Harbour site - Wave - Delayed mode",
    "Description": "The Coffs Harbour (COF) HF ocean radar site is located near the point at which the East Australian Current (EAC) begins to separate from the coast.  Here the EAC is at its narrowest and swiftest: to the north it is forming from the westwards subtropical jet, and to the south it forms eddies and eventually the warm water moves eastwards across the Tasman Sea, forming a front with the cold water of the Southern Ocean.  \n\nThe connection between coastal and continental shelf waters is fundamental to the understanding of the anthropogenic impact on the coastal ocean and the role of the ocean in mitigating urban marine water quality. The oceans off Eastern Australia and in particular in the region of New South Wales have a complex circulation structure, and are strongly connected with other regional seas and currents. \n\nThe East Australia Current (EAC) flows from tropical regions southward along the NSW continental slope, bringing tropical biota southward. These current structures provide strong physical and biological connectivity, allowing substantial transport and dispersion of biota between regions, and influencing the transport and upwelling of nutrients, which are fundamental to biological productivity.  \n\nThe COF HF ocean radar is a WERA phased array system with 16-element receive arrays located at Red Rock (-23.942 S, 151.371 E) to the north of Coffs Harbour and North Nambucca (-24.111 S, 152.713 E) to the south.  The area of focus is off Coffs Harbour where IMOS and the NSW government have mooring sites.  These radars operate at a frequency of 13.920 MHz, with a bandwidth of 100 KHz and a maximum range of 100 Km.  Within the HF radar coverage area surface currents are measured.  Data are also collected from which wind directions and significant wave height can be calculated.",

    "Description": "NOAA's Climate Data Records (CDRs) are robust, sustainable, and scientifically sound climate records that provide trustworthy information on how, where, and to what extent the land, oceans, atmosphere and ice sheets are changing. These datasets are thoroughly vetted time series measurements with the longevity, consistency, and continuity to assess and measure climate variability and change. NOAA CDRs are vetted using standards established by the National Research Council (NRC).<br/><br/>\nClimate Data Records are created by merging data from surface, atmosphere, and space-based systems across decades. NOAA’s Climate Data Records provides authoritative and traceable long-term climate records. NOAA developed CDRs by applying modern data analysis methods to historical global satellite data. This process can clarify the underlying climate trends within the data and allows researchers and other users to identify economic and scientific value in these records. NCEI maintains and extends CDRs by applying the same methods to present-day and future satellite measurements.<br/><br/>\nAtmospheric Climate Data Records are measurements of several global variables to help characterize the atmosphere at or just above the land and ocean surface as well as other upper air composition variables.\n",

    "Name": "Ocean Radar - Capricorn bunker group site - Sea water velocity - Delayed mode",
    "Description": "The Capricorn Bunker Group site is in the southern region  of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park World Heritage Area (GBR).  The HF ocean radar coverage is from the coast to beyond the edge of the continental shelf.  This is an area where the East Australian Current (EAC) meanders as it moves south from the Swain Reefs and loses touch with the western land boundary.  The area is dynamic with warm EAC water recirculating and being wind-driven northwards along the coast inside the GBR lagoon.  The recirculating warm water contrasts with the upwelling tendency of the parts of the EAC which continue to move southwards.  The CBG radar is ideally placed to follow filaments of different water types and to investigate their impacts on coral reefs and fisheries.  \n\nApplications of the CBG radar data are in the frequency and location of regional upwelling that fuels productivity, and in the connectivity between reefs and islands.  At the central point of the CBG area of coverage is the  Heron Island Research Station which hosts many coral reef and ecology research programs.  The data will also be useful for validation of the operational Bluelink model, and the embedded higher resolution Whole-of-Reef model.   \n\nThe CBG HF ocean radar is a WERA phased array system with 12-element receive arrays located at Tannum Sands (-23.942 S, 151.371 E) and Lady Elliot Island (-24.111 S, 152.713 E).  These radars operate at a frequency of 8.348 MHz, with a bandwidth of 33 KHz and a maximum range of 200 Km and a range resolution of 4.5 Km.  Within the HF radar coverage area surface currents are measured.  Data are also collected from which wind directions and significant wave height can be calculated.  \n\nThe capital funding for this system was provided originally as an ARC LEIF Grant, assisted by contributions from James Cook University, The University of Queensland, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and the Australian Institute of Marine Science.\n\nThis site was decommissioned in April 2017.",

Older versions will no longer be available and have been superseded by Version 07.\n.\n\n2ADPR provides single- and dual-frequency-derived precipitation estimates from the Ku and Ka radars of the Dual-Frequency Precipitation Radar (DPR) on the core GPM spacecraft. The output consists of three main classes of precipitation products: those derived from the Ku-band frequency over a wide swath (245 km), those derived from the Ka-band frequency over a narrow swath (125 km), and those derived from the dual-frequency data over the narrow swath. The Ka-band results are further divided into the standard and high-sensitivity estimates. In the standard sensitivity mode, the fields of view within the inner swath are matched to those of the Ku-band. Data from these matched-beam Ku- and Ka-band fields of view are used to derive the dual-frequency precipitation products. The retrievals are performed at each radar range bin along the slant path of the radar instrument field of view (IFOV).\nRead our doc on how to get AWS Credentials to retrieve this data: https://data.gesdisc.earthdata.nasa.gov/s3credentialsREADME",

    "Name": "GPM IMERG Final Precipitation L3 1 month 0.1 degree x 0.1 degree V07 (GPM_3IMERGM) at GES DISC",
    "Description": "Version 07B is the current version of the IMERG data sets. Older versions will no longer be available and have been superseded by Version 07.\n\nThe Integrated Multi-satellitE Retrievals for GPM (IMERG) is the unified U.S. algorithm that provides the multi-satellite precipitation product for the U.S. GPM team.\n\nThe precipitation estimates from the various precipitation-relevant satellite passive microwave (PMW) sensors comprising the GPM constellation are computed using the 2021 version of the Goddard Profiling Algorithm (GPROF2021), then gridded, intercalibrated to the GPM Combined Ku Radar-Radiometer Algorithm (CORRA) product, and merged into half-hourly 0.1°x0.1° (roughly 10x10 km) fields. Note that CORRA is adjusted to the monthly Global Precipitation Climatology Project (GPCP) Satellite-Gauge (SG) product over high-latitude ocean to correct known biases.\n\nThe half-hourly intercalibrated merged PMW estimates are then input to both a Morphing-Kalman Filter (KF) Lagrangian time interpolation scheme based on work by the Climate Prediction Center (CPC) and the Precipitation Estimation from Remotely Sensed Information using Artificial Neural Networks (PERSIANN) Dynamic Infrared–Rain Rate (PDIR) re-calibration scheme. In parallel, CPC assembles the zenith-angle-corrected, intercalibrated merged geo-IR fields and forwards them to PPS for input to the PERSIANN-CCS algorithm (supported by an asynchronous re-calibration cycle) which are then input to the KF morphing (quasi-Lagrangian time interpolation) scheme.\n\nThe KF morphing (supported by an asynchronous KF weights updating cycle) uses the PMW and IR estimates to create half-hourly estimates. Motion vectors for the morphing are computed by maximizing the pattern correlation of successive hours within each of the precipitation (PRECTOT), total precipitable liquid water (TQL), and vertically integrated vapor (TQV) data fields provided by the Modern-Era Retrospective Analysis for Research and Applications, Version 2 (MERRA-2) and Goddard Earth Observing System model Version 5 (GEOS-5) Forward Processing (FP) for the post-real-time (Final) Run and the near-real-time (Early and Late) Runs, respectively. The vectors from PRECTOT are chosen if available, else from TQL, if available, else from TQV. The KF uses the morphed data as the “forecast” and the IR estimates as the “observations”, with weighting that depends on the time interval(s) away from the microwave overpass time. The IR becomes important after about ±90 minutes away from the overpass time. Variable averaging in the KF is accounted for in a routine (Scheme for Histogram Adjustment with Ranked Precipitation Estimates in the Neighborhood, or SHARPEN) that compares the local histogram of KF morphed precipitation to the local histogram of forward- and backward-morphed microwave data and the IR.\n\nThe IMERG system is run twice in near-real time:\n\n\"Early\" multi-satellite product ~4 hr after observation time using only forward morphing and\n\"Late\" multi-satellite product ~14 hr after observation time, using both forward and backward morphing\nand once after the monthly gauge analysis is received:\n\n\"Final\", satellite-gauge product ~4 months after the observation month, using both forward and backward morphing and including monthly gauge analyses.\n\nIn V07, the near-real-time Early and Late half-hourly estimates have a monthly climatological concluding calibration based on averaging the concluding calibrations computed in the Final, while in the post-real-time Final Run the multi-satellite half-hourly estimates are adjusted so that they sum to the Final Run monthly satellite-gauge combination. In all cases the output contains multiple fields that provide information on the input data, selected intermediate fields, and estimation quality. In general, the complete calibrated precipitation, precipitation, is the data field of choice for most users.\n\nBriefly describing the Final Run, the input precipitation estimates computed from the various satellite passive microwave sensors are intercalibrated to the CORRA product (because it is presumed to be the best snapshot TRMM/GPM estimate after adjustment to the monthly GPCP SG), then \"forward/backward morphed\" and combined with microwave precipitation-calibrated geo-IR fields, and adjusted with seasonal GPCP SG surface precipitation data to provide half-hourly and monthly precipitation estimates on a 0.1°x0.1° (roughly 10x10 km) grid over the globe. Precipitation phase is a diagnostic variable computed using analyses of surface temperature, humidity, and pressure.

LAMBDA hosts the data archives of over 30 different CMB missions spanning 30+ years. The data archive for each mission may contain a range of data types from low-level time-ordered data to high level science-ready products such as sky maps and angular power spectra. Also provided in consistent formats are a variety of full sky maps in complementary wavebands that are useful for CMB analysis, such as maps of radio synchrotron or infrared dust emission.\n<br/><br/>\nData provided here are normally stored in the generic Flexible Image Transport System ([FITS](https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/heasarc/fits.html)) format common in astronomy. Sky maps are generally provided in the Hierarchical Equal-Area isoLatitude Pixelization ([HEALPix](https://healpix.sourceforge.io/)) scheme, though the older COsmic Background Explorer (COBE) data is stored in COBE Quadrilateralizated Spherical Cube pixelization ([CSC](https://lambda.gsfc.nasa.gov/product/cobe/skymap_info_new.html)). See the links for each mission for more information on the data and how to use it.

The view angle effects are removed from the directional reflectances, resulting in a stable and consistent NBAR product. Data are temporally weighted to the ninth day which is reflected in the Julian date in the file name.\n\nUsers are urged to use the band specific quality flags to isolate the highest quality full inversion results for their own science applications as described in the [User Guide](https://www.umb.edu/spectralmass/modis-user-guide-v006-and-v0061/mcd43a4-nbar-product/).\n\nThe MCD43A4 provides NBAR and simplified mandatory quality layers for MODIS bands 1 through 7. Essential quality information provided in the corresponding [MCD43A2](https://doi.org/10.5067/MODIS/MCD43A2.061) data file should be consulted when using this product.\n\nKnown Issues\n\n* For complete information about known issues please refer to the [MODIS/VIIRS Land Quality Assessment website](https://landweb.modaps.eosdis.nasa.gov/knownissue?sensor=MODIS&sat=TerraAqua&as=61).\n\nImprovements/Changes from Previous Versions\n\n* The Version 6.1 Level-1B (L1B) products have been improved by undergoing various calibration changes that include: changes to the response-versus-scan angle (RVS) approach that affects reflectance bands for Aqua and Terra MODIS, corrections to adjust for the optical crosstalk in Terra MODIS infrared (IR) bands, and corrections to the Terra MODIS forward look-up table (LUT) update for the period 2012 - 2017.\n* A polarization correction has been applied to the L1B Reflective Solar Bands (RSB).\nRead our doc on how to get AWS Credentials to retrieve this data: https://data.lpdaac.earthdatacloud.nasa.gov/s3credentialsREADME",

    "Name": "Ocean Radar - Capricorn bunker group site - Wind - Delayed mode",
    "Description": "The Capricorn Bunker Group site is in the southern region  of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park World Heritage Area (GBR).  The HF ocean radar coverage is from the coast to beyond the edge of the continental shelf.  This is an area where the East Australian Current (EAC) meanders as it moves south from the Swain Reefs and loses touch with the western land boundary.  The area is dynamic with warm EAC water recirculating and being wind-driven northwards along the coast inside the GBR lagoon.  The recirculating warm water contrasts with the upwelling tendency of the parts of the EAC which continue to move southwards.  The CBG radar is ideally placed to follow filaments of different water types and to investigate their impacts on coral reefs and fisheries.  \n\nApplications of the CBG radar data are in the frequency and location of regional upwelling that fuels productivity, and in the connectivity between reefs and islands.  At the central point of the CBG area of coverage is the  Heron Island Research Station which hosts many coral reef and ecology research programs.  The data will also be useful for validation of the operational Bluelink model, and the embedded higher resolution Whole-of-Reef model.   \n\nThe CBG HF ocean radar is a WERA phased array system with 12-element receive arrays located at Tannum Sands (-23.942 S, 151.371 E) and Lady Elliot Island (-24.111 S, 152.713 E).  These radars operate at a frequency of 8.348 MHz, with a bandwidth of 33 KHz and a maximum range of 200 Km and a range resolution of 4.5 Km.  Within the HF radar coverage area surface currents are measured.  Data are also collected from which wind directions and significant wave height can be calculated.  \n\nThe capital funding for this system was provided originally as an ARC LEIF Grant, assisted by contributions from James Cook University, The University of Queensland, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and the Australian Institute of Marine Science.\n\nThis site was decommissioned in April 2017.",
